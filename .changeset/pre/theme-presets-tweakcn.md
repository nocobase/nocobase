Ship 30 more theme presets, converted from the tweakcn collection.

An application now starts with 32 presets to choose from in Settings → Theme: the two it had, and 30 palettes covering minimal, warm, pastel, brutalist, terminal and night looks. A converted file states the same tokens as the shipped presets — the fonts, text sizes, spacing and shadows Default defines — and takes only the colours and corner radius from upstream, so each one reads as Default with a different palette and none needs a font resource. The upstream opacity, shadow, letter-spacing and spacing values stay out, which is what keeps CJK rendering and density consistent across the grid.

The palettes are the upstream ones and have not been re-audited for contrast against this application's components. The theme reference now records the conversion rules, and `client/theme/themes/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` in each template names the source revision, the Apache-2.0 licence and the values the conversion drops.
