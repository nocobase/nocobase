Publish the `database/` directory by part rather than whole, so generated Collection artifacts stay out of the tarball.

`files` listed `database`, and npm applies that whitelist ahead of every ignore file, so whatever `pnpm collections:generate` had written under `database/<connection>/collections/` was published with the template. Those files are a snapshot of one machine's database, down to the dialect's physical types and Oracle's generated sequence names, so what a template shipped depended on whether someone had run the generator locally and against what. Neither `.gitignore` nor `.npmignore` could take them back out. `@nocobase/app-template-examples` was carrying 214 such files, 1.1 MB, from an Oracle database, in a template whose `config.example.yml` offers SQLite.

`files` now names `database/tsconfig.json`, `database/*/migrations/**` and `database/*/seeds/**`, plus Examples' `database/externalCrm/collections/**`, which is the metadata source for an external connection rather than generated output. Each template also ignores its managed connections' collections directories, and `create-app` writes the same entry into a generated application.
