Expire a task lock whose holder was killed, and add `nocobase app db unlock` to inspect and release one.

A run that is hard-killed — SIGKILL, a stopped container, a lost machine — runs no cleanup, so its lock row survived it and every later run waited out the acquire timeout and then failed, until somebody deleted the row by hand. A holder now refreshes a `heartbeat_at` column every five seconds while it works, and a lock that has not been refreshed for thirty seconds is taken over by the next run, which then continues normally. The takeover is reported through `onStaleLock` and logged by the application, because it means a previous run did not shut down cleanly. A working run is never taken over: several missed beats are tolerated, so a slow database does not hand the lock to a second run.

The lock table gains `heartbeat_at`, added in place when the table predates it. It cannot be a migration: the lock is what every migration runs inside.

`db unlock` reports who holds each lock — the owner, when it was taken, and its last heartbeat — and releases the ones that have stopped beating. A lock that is still beating is reported rather than released; `--force` releases it anyway, which lets a second run start beside the first. It covers the migration and the seed lock together, takes `--connection` / `--all` / `--json` like the other database commands, and needs no migration or seed directory, since startup and plugins take the same locks. The three templates gain a `db:unlock` script.

`Migrator` and `Seeder` gain `lock()`, which reads the lock without creating its table, and `unlock(options)`. `AppDatabaseTaskOperation` gains `'unlock'`, and a task result carries `lock`, `released` and `lockReason`. The exhausted-wait message now names the last heartbeat and points at `db unlock` rather than at deleting a row by hand.
