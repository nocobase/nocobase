Stop a dependency install from restarting the development server mid-way, refuse a second development server for one application root, and shorten the development shutdown budget so a restart is not force-killed.

`package.json` was handed to the file watcher as an `--include`, so an install restarted the server on its first write and again on the later ones. The server came back against a half-installed `node_modules`, and a write arriving while it was still shutting down is where the watcher escalates SIGTERM to SIGKILL — which skips releasing the migration lock. The manifest, the lockfile and the package manager's install state are now watched here instead, and the restart waits for all of them to stay quiet, so one install produces one restart.

A second `pnpm dev` for the same application root is refused, naming the first one's process id. Nothing else caught it: the port check advances to the next free port, and the duplicate then failed on the migration lock the first server holds, before it bound anything — an error that names neither cause nor remedy. `NOCOBASE_DEV_ALLOW_MULTIPLE=true` starts one anyway, a run that only proxies a remote backend does not take the lock, and a lock left by a killed run is taken over rather than reported.

`APP_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` sets the total shutdown budget: the force exit lands on it and the HTTP drain a second earlier. `pnpm dev` supplies four seconds, inside the five the watcher waits before force-killing, so a development restart shuts down on its own and releases its locks. A deployment keeps the 30 second drain and 35 second force exit, which suit a load balancer. `resolveNodeShutdownTimeouts` is exported and `StandaloneServer` carries the resolved `shutdownOptions`.

Checksum drift now names both ways out instead of one. `db repair` was the only suggestion, and it is the wrong one whenever the edit changed what the migration does: repair records that the source and the schema agree, so using it there makes an un-applied change look applied. The CLI and the startup log now point at `db repair` for an edit that left the schema identical and at `db redo` for one that did not.
