Ship the `nocobase-deployment` Skill with `@nocobase/app-skills`, so `nocobase skills sync` delivers it to every generated application instead of leaving it in the source repository where an application's agent never sees it. The Skill now reads the application's own README rather than repository paths, says that `pnpm build` already installs production dependencies into `dist/` and that `pnpm install --prod` there is a repair rather than a deployment step, and names both ways to enable a workflow whose deployed hash changed: **Enable new version** in workflow management, or the enable route called with the new hash. Each template's `AGENTS.md` points at the Skill next to the upgrade Skill, and the README's deployment section explains the same `pnpm install --prod` relationship.
