Move the password authentication pages to the application. The authentication plugin keeps only the protocol, session state, guards and headless actions: it no longer declares `/login`, `/register`, `/forgot-password` or `/reset-password`, drops the `client/routes` and `client/route-contracts` entries, and removes the `loginPage`/`registerPage` route override options.

Each application template now declares those four guest routes in `client/routes.ts` and loads the application-owned pages from `client/pages/auth/`, which compose the preinstalled UI from `client/extensions/nocobase-auth-ui/`. The pages use ordinary relative links; URL handling remains with the application router and basename.
