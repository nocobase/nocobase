Add `nocobase app config init`, which writes the configuration file an application starts from, and run it in an application with `pnpm config:init`.

It generates `config.yml` from the application's `config.example.yml` so the example's comments reach the file people edit, fills in `auth.secret` and `session.secret`, and points `database.connections.main` at the selected dialect while leaving every other connection alone. The dialect defaults to the installed driver when there is exactly one, is asked for on a terminal when there are several, and must be given with `--dialect` in a script.

The command installs nothing. Which dialects an application can run on is decided by the driver it depends on, so a missing one is reported with the `pnpm add` that supplies it — pinned to the range the installed `@nocobase/app-server` declares for that driver, because the newest release is not necessarily one the runtime was built against — rather than installed behind the user's back — in a deployment, where adding a driver to a built `dist` would be undone by the next build, it reports that the application has to be built again instead. Everything is validated before anything is written, so a run that reports a problem leaves the directory untouched and can simply be repeated once the driver is there.

The three application templates now declare `@nocobase/db-sqlite`, the driver their own `server/config/database.ts` defaults to, so a new application can be configured and started without installing one first.

`@nocobase/app-server` exports `OFFICIAL_DIALECTS` and `OfficialDialect` from `@nocobase/app-server/database`, so tooling that has to name the dialects reads the same list the runtime loads drivers from.

The application development and deployment Skills describe the new step: how an application is configured, that the driver decides which dialects it can run on, and that a deployment writes its configuration with `pnpm config:init` inside `dist/`, from the `config.example.yml` the archive carries. The database Skill shipped with `@nocobase/db` now points at `pnpm config:init` rather than at a creation flag that no longer exists.
