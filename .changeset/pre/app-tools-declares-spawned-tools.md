Declare `tsx` and `typescript` as peer dependencies of `@nocobase/app-tools`, and stop loading the TypeScript compiler on every `pnpm dev`.

`dev` spawns three executables it never imports — `vite`, `tsx`, and `nocobase` — and only two of them were declared. `tsx` sat in `devDependencies`, which are not installed for a consumer, so an application that installed `@nocobase/app-tools` from a registry carried no statement that it needed one. Nothing caught it: every template declares `tsx` for its own use, so the binary resolves in this repository and in any application generated from a template, and is absent only in an application that never installed it. Neither `pnpm deps:check` nor `pnpm peers:check` could have caught it either, because both read import specifiers and a spawned binary has none. Both checks now cover `packages/tools`, the package README carries a table of the executables these scripts spawn, and AGENTS.md records that a spawned tool is a dependency too.

`typescript` moves from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` for a different reason. It is imported directly, to parse `server/plugins.ts` without running it, while the build compiles through the application's own `pnpm exec tsc`. That is two copies, and a version split between them fails silently: the application compiles syntax the older parser then cannot read, `resolvePluginWatchIncludes` returns nothing, and editing a workspace plugin quietly stops restarting the server. **An application that does not already declare `typescript` must add it** — every template does, so an application generated from one needs no change.

That parse is now gated as well. It can only ever name a workspace neighbour, so a `server/plugins.ts` naming none of them is answered without importing the compiler at all. Every `pnpm dev` in a generated application was loading 24 MB of TypeScript to be told there was nothing to watch. `resolvePluginWatchIncludes` is asynchronous as a result.

`cross-spawn` and `tar` move to the workspace catalog, which also settles `tar` on a single range: `@nocobase/app-host` and `@nocobase/app-plugin-hub` were one minor version behind the four other declarations. The three templates drop their own `cross-spawn` and `tar` entries, which nothing in them has imported since these scripts moved into `@nocobase/app-tools`.
