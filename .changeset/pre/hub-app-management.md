Register the Application Hub in the Hub template and provide an application control plane. Release artifacts supply their version and an optional `config.example.yml` or `config.example.yaml` template, while applications choose Config file or External configuration and reserve Hub-managed configuration for a future database-backed implementation. Hub actions reconcile only the selected application, reuse an already installed matching artifact, report deployment phase timings, and support removing an application and its persisted resources. Separate Hub desired configuration files from Host-owned runtime configuration, rebuild recovery targets when Host becomes ready, and split the management page into business modules.
