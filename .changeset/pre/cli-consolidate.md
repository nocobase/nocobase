`@nocobase/app-cli` is now the whole application command line: it provides the `nocobase` bin and absorbs `@nocobase/nb3-cli` (command assembly, the plugin contract, plugin and Skill management) and `@nocobase/app-tools` (`dev`, `build`, `start`, `server-deps`). Neither of those two packages is published any more, and there is no compatibility period.

- **Commands.** Standard commands leave the `app` topic: `nocobase db apply`, `nocobase config init`, `nocobase collections generate`. `app db doctor` is now `collections doctor`, `app i18n:check` is now `locales check`, and `app upload`/`app deploy` are `release upload`/`release deploy`, registered only when `package.json` sets `nocobase.cli.publishing: true`. New commands `dev`, `build`, `start`, `dist retarget` and `dist check` replace the application's `scripts/*.mjs`. `plugin skills sync` and `plugin cli-hooks` are removed; use `skills sync`. `app` now holds only an application's own commands.
- **Discovery.** Commands are found by path: an application's `cli/commands/orders/sync.ts` answers to `nocobase app orders sync`, with no index to maintain. The bin finds the application from the nearest `package.json` (`nocobase.templateKind` for a source checkout, `nocobase.buildTarget` for a built `dist/`), or from `NOCOBASE_APP_ROOT`; applications no longer have a `cli/index.ts`. A built-in command runs without importing the application's plugins.
- **Plugins.** A plugin's topic is its package name without the scope and `app-plugin-` prefix, so the scheduler's commands move from `schedule` to `scheduler` and the CLI example's from `demo` to `cli-example`. `defineCliPlugin` accepts `devCommands`, which a built `dist/` leaves out; the workflow plugin's `check` and `build` are development commands. Plugins declare `@nocobase/app-cli` as their peer instead of `@nocobase/nb3-cli`.
- **Deployment.** `nocobase build` writes `dist/cli/index.js`, so `node dist/cli/index.js db apply` runs from any directory without pnpm; `dist/package.json` keeps only the `start` and `nocobase` scripts. The `migrate` and `seed` scripts it used to generate pointed at commands that no longer existed and are gone. Development tooling (`typescript`, `tsx`, `vite`, `prettier`, `tar`, `@nocobase/dev-config`) is an optional peer, so a deployment installs none of it.
- **Templates.** Scripts are reduced to `postinstall`, `dev`, `build`, `start` and the quality checks; every other command is `pnpm nocobase <topic> <command>`. `scripts/`, `cli/index.ts` and `cli/commands/index.ts` are removed.

Upgrading an existing application requires moving to the new layout in one step: see "Shared application scripts and commands" in the `nocobase-app-upgrade` Skill (`packages/app/app-skills/skills/nocobase-app-upgrade/references/edge-cases.md`) for the full procedure. Messages that named `nocobase app db repair` and similar commands now name the new ids.
