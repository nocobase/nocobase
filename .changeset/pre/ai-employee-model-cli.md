Add runtime `ai-employee models` and `ai-employee test` commands to discover built-in provider model IDs and verify model access before application startup, without connecting to the database or exposing credentials or completion content. Both commands support the standard CLI JSON envelope.

Register the commands in the Default and Examples templates and document selecting initial enabled models before the first startup. Existing applications must register `@nocobase/app-plugin-ai-employee/cli` in `cli/plugins.ts` and provide the plugin's `@nocobase/app-cli` and `@oclif/core` peers as production dependencies. Model selection for already initialized services remains in the management UI; these commands do not modify database model lists.
