Fix `client:inspect`, which failed with `.glob is not a function`.

The command runs under tsx and imported the application's client declaration modules directly. Those modules are written for a bundler: `client/source-extensions.ts` calls `import.meta.glob()`, which only a bundler implements. This surfaced once `client/runtime.ts` began importing source extensions — before that the inspector never reached a module that needed one.

Declarations now load through Vite, so aliases such as `@/` and compile-time `define` constants resolve exactly as they do in a real build, rather than being an approximation the inspector maintains separately. The environment is configured to transform modules and nothing else — no HMR, websocket, file watching, or dependency pre-bundling — because each of those leaves a handle open that stops the command from exiting once it has printed its result. The server is closed on every path, including failures.

The tests missed this because they run under Vitest, which is built on Vite and therefore implements `import.meta.glob` — the declaration modules loaded fine there while the real command was broken. `client:inspect` is now also exercised as a child process under tsx, the way a developer runs it, and that test fails if the loader regresses or if the command stops exiting on its own.
