Add `nocobase app db rollback` and `nocobase app db redo`, so a migration corrected before its branch is merged can be re-run without resetting the database.

Editing an executed migration changes nothing on its own: it is recorded as executed, so `db apply` skips it and the database keeps the schema the old source produced. Until now the only way forward was `db reset`, which drops every managed table and every row with it, or editing the history table by hand — which the documentation forbids, and which splits the two records of what exists: dropping a table without its metadata record leaves the Collection unresolvable.

`db rollback` runs `down()` for the latest migration batch, newest first, and deletes its history records. The batch is the unit the history records, so a batch that mixed application and plugin migrations rolls back as one, and the confirmation lists every migration with the package it belongs to before anything runs. It fails having run nothing when a migration in the batch is irreversible or has no `down()`. `db redo` is that followed by `db apply`. Both are destructive in the same way and confirm the same way: CI and non-interactive terminals require `--force`, `--connection` and `--all` select connections as they do elsewhere, and `--json` carries the result. Seeds are not re-run, so rows a seed inserted into a table the batch recreates are not restored.

`Migrator.rollback()` accepts `{ dryRun: true }`, which is what the confirmation is built from: it takes the lock, resolves the batch, rejects an irreversible one, and reports what a run would undo without running any `down`. `MigrationRollbackResult` gains `records` — the batch's history records in rollback order, carrying each migration's package — and `dryRun`. `AppDatabaseTaskOperation` gains `'rollback'`, which applies to migrations alone: a plan including seeds is refused, because seeds have no inverse.

The three templates gain `db:rollback` and `db:redo` scripts. The migrations reference now documents re-running a corrected migration, states what `db:repair` is and is not for — it records that the schema already matches, so using it on a change the database never received leaves the schema wrong and nothing recording that — and lists each internal table with the command that maintains it.
