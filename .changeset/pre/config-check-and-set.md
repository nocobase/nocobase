Add `nocobase app config check` and `nocobase app config set`, run in an application as `pnpm config:check` and `pnpm config:set`, so a configuration is written by `config:init`, changed by `config:set` and verified by `config:check`.

`config:check` loads the configuration through the application itself — its files, its environment and its code defaults — without starting it. A file that fails to parse, or a database driver that is not installed, fails here for the same reason it would fail a start. It then reports what loading alone does not show: a secret missing or still the placeholder, a `session.secret` that is regenerated at every start and so ends every session with the process, a top-level section nothing reads with the name that was probably meant, and a `${NAME}` written where it is not expanded and would be used as literal text. Databases other than SQLite are connected to, one connection each taken from the pool and handed back, without running SQL or migrating anything; `--connect` includes SQLite and `--no-connect` stays offline. Each finding carries the key and, where there is one, a command that fixes it, and the command exits non-zero on any error, or on any warning with `--strict`.

`config:set` sets `key=value` assignments in the file the application reads, keeping its comments, and writes it once. A key under a section the application does not know is refused with the nearest known one, so a typo fails instead of being written where nothing reads it. With `--from-env` each value names an environment variable to read, so a secret stays out of the command line. After writing it loads the configuration again and reports any key an environment variable overrides.

`config:init` now returns its `nextCommands` and, for a database other than SQLite, the `requiredSettings` still at a placeholder. On a terminal it asks for them, reading the password without echo, and tries the connection before writing. Run on an application that is already configured it leaves the file alone and reports `unchanged`, failing only when `--dialect` asks for a different database than the one configured.

A built `dist/package.json` carries `config:check` and `config:set` scripts, and its `pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets `verifyDepsBeforeRun: false`, so running one of a deployment's own scripts never makes pnpm install first. `create-app` includes `pnpm config:check` in the `nextCommands` it returns.

`AppConfig` gains `layers()`, which returns the code defaults and the values the application's own sources supply as separate read-only copies — the distinction a check needs to tell a known section from a misspelled one.
