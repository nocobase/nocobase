Index `client/pages/reference/` so an agent can find the right page instead of listing the directory. A new `README.md` there maps the screen being built to the example page and the blocks inside it, and the interaction needed to the component page that demonstrates the primitive, with the Base UI API detail each one is easy to get wrong; every example page now opens with a module comment naming the patterns it holds, the component or block holding each one, and the parts that are demonstration filler.

The application development Skill points at that README and turns "read a worked page" into ordered steps: pick the page from the table, read its header, open only the blocks the task needs, check the primitives exist, copy the skeleton without the mock data or frame, and move the strings into the application locales. Its components reference gains a section on Base UI composition — `render` in place of `asChild`, `data-icon` on icons beside text, grouped menu items, nullable `onValueChange` values — and a table of the compositions the template ships in `client/components/`, including that `toast.add` needs a `Toaster` the shell does not mount.
