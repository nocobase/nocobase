Report a reused Hub deployment honestly. A repeated `app deploy` for the same Release and configuration is answered from the earlier idempotent request, so the Hub now returns `reused` and the deployment's `createdAt` with the accepted operation, and the CLI reports that field and warns that nothing was deployed now instead of printing the same success line as a new deployment. Existing retries keep their exit code; only the output changes.
