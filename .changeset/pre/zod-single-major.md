Depend on one zod major, so a deployment can resolve better-auth

An application that installed both the AI employee plugin and the API keys plugin failed to start with `z.ipv4 is not a function`, thrown while loading `@better-auth/core`. Nothing in better-auth was wrong: the AI employee packages asked for `zod: ^3` while better-auth asks for `^4`, and a deployment installs `dist/` with `nodeLinker: hoisted`, where one version of a package takes the root slot and the rest are nested underneath whoever depends on them. zod 3 won the root, which forced better-auth's whole subtree to be nested, and a `@better-auth/core` that ended up next to the root zod bound to the wrong major.

The same collision has a second failure mode that is harder to read. `@better-auth/api-key` declares `@better-auth/core`, `better-call`, `jose`, `kysely` and `nanostores` as peer dependencies, and a deployment sets `autoInstallPeers: false` so it installs none of them. It works anyway when better-auth's dependencies hoist to the root, because the peers are then sitting where the resolver looks; it stops working the moment the zod conflict pushes them down into `node_modules/better-auth/node_modules`, and the application fails with `Cannot find package '@better-auth/core'`.

So the fix is not to declare better-auth's internals somewhere. `@nocobase/ai-employee` never imported zod at all and no longer declares it, `@nocobase/app-plugin-ai-employee` moves to zod 4, and all three templates and the plugin now take it from the `zod` catalog entry, so one version is what an application gets. Its schemas use `z.object`, `z.string`, `z.number`, `z.array`, `z.record`, `z.coerce`, `z.any` and `z.unknown`, all of which carry over unchanged; `buildStandardAgentMiddleware` gained an explicit `AgentMiddleware[]` return type, which the new resolution made necessary.

A deployment tree now holds a single `zod` and a single `@better-auth/core`, hoisted to the root where `@better-auth/api-key` resolves them.
