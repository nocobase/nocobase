Rewrite the template's package name into the generated application's own, in `client/runtime.ts`, `client/service-provider.ts`, and `server/providers/app-example.ts`, and set `displayName` to the application name instead of dropping it. The client previously declared an i18n namespace the server did not share, and `pnpm client:inspect` refused to run because the two disagreed.
