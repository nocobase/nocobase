Add `defineDevRoutes()`, for pages that exist only while developing an application.

It takes the same shape as `defineSettingsRoutes()` — pages, one level of groups, `navigation` and `access` — and mounts under `/dev` instead of `/settings`. The two are separate path spaces, so the same relative path may appear in both and resolve to `/settings/orders` and `/dev/orders`.

What makes it different is that nothing it declares reaches a production bundle. The guard lives inside `defineDevRoutes()` rather than at each call site, so a plugin author calls it unconditionally the way they call `defineSettingsRoutes()` and cannot forget it. A production build replaces `import.meta.env.PROD` with `true`, which makes the argument unreachable and lets the bundler drop the page components behind it, along with any module only those pages import. The templates guard their `/dev` route and the dev entry in the header the same way, so a production build carries no dev route, no dev layout chunk, and no dev entry point.

This draws its boundary at the build output, not at runtime permissions. A page that has to exist in production but be restricted by role is still a Settings Route with `access`, enforced by the server.

Both templates' headers offer a dev entry beside the settings gear, visible only during development. A surface withdraws its own entry: the settings centre shows the dev entry but not the gear, the dev tools show the gear but not the dev entry, and the application shell shows both.

Both templates gain a `client/layouts/` directory. The settings centre's chrome — the navigation rail, group disclosures, the mobile page select, and the per-page access filtering — is now one `SurfaceLayout` that the settings centre and the dev tools each render with their own copy, rather than a second copy of the same layout. The Hub template's settings navigation picks up the translation the default template already had.

`client:inspect` reports the resolved dev routes and accepts `--type dev-routes`.
