# SchemaInitializer

[SchemaInitializer](/plugin-development/client) is used to add various blocks, fields, actions, and more to the interface.

Depending on your needs, there may be the following extension scenarios:

- Add items to an existing Initializer
- Create a new Initializer

Based on the scenarios above, we provide the following examples:
