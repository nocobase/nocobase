After authorization is complete, you will be redirected back to NocoBase. Select the synchronization start time to associate the account and synchronize data (the first synchronization may take a long time, please wait).

After data synchronization is complete, the current page will automatically close and return to the original email message page. At this point, you can see that the account has been associated.
