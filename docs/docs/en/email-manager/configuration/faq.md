# FAQ

## Emails Cannot Be Received After Authorizing a Microsoft Account

**Answer:** Currently only Outlook and Gmail email accounts support authorization login, Microsoft accounts and Google accounts are not supported. Please refer to: [answers.microsoft.com](https://answers.microsoft.com/zh-hans/outlook_com/forum/all/%E7%8E%B0%E6%9C%89%E5%BE%AE%E8%BD%AF%E8%B4%A6/dba12dda-a7c7-4346-8263-53f4a6d9dc68)

**Tip:** If you are unsure whether you have a "real Outlook.com email" or "Gmail email", you can try accessing Outlook.com or Gmail.com via web browser to check if you can log in directly and send emails normally. If not, it may mean you have not activated the corresponding email service and need to activate it or use a different email provider.
