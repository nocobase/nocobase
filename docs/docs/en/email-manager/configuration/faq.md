# FAQ

## Emails cannot be received after authorizing with a Microsoft account

A: Currently, only Outlook email accounts and Gmail email accounts are supported for authorized login. Microsoft accounts and Google accounts are not supported for now. For reference, see: [answers.microsoft.com](https://answers.microsoft.com/zh-hans/outlook_com/forum/all/%E7%8E%B0%E6%9C%89%E5%BE%AE%E8%BD%AF%E8%B4%A6/dba12dda-a7c7-4346-8263-53f4a6d9dc68)

**Tip**: If you are not sure whether you have a "real Outlook.com email" or a "Gmail email", you can try visiting Outlook.com or Gmail.com in your web browser to see if you can log in directly and send emails normally. If not, it means you may not have the corresponding email service and need to activate it first or use a different email.
