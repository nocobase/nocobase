# FormBlockModel

Form block model: the block model type for form blocks (Form, EditForm, etc.). In RunJS, when the current JS runs inside a form block, `ctx.blockModel` is often a FormBlockModel (or EditFormModel). See [ctx.blockModel](../context/block-model.md) and [ctx.form](../context/form.md) for usage.
