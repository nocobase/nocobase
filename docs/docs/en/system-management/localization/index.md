## Introduction

The Localization Management plugin is used to manage and implement NocoBase's localization resources. It can translate system menus, data tables, fields, and all plugins to adapt to the language and culture of specific regions.

## Installation

This plugin is built-in and requires no additional installation.

Currently, the following content can be synchronized:

- Local language packs for the system and plugins
- Collection titles, field titles, and field option labels
- Menu titles

After synchronization, the system will list all translatable entries for the current language.

Different modules may have the same original text entries, which need to be translated separately.
