# NocoBase 2.0 Release Log

NocoBase has finally launched version 2.0! This major release completely refactors the front-end architecture and introduces innovative AI Employees, bringing a brand new experience to your application management and automation processes.

## New Features

### All-New Documentation Site

To help users learn and master NocoBase faster, we have completely revamped our official documentation. From basic getting started guides to advanced development, the content is more detailed and the structure is clearer.

> Some content is still being added.

### Front-end FlowEngine

FlowEngine is a brand-new no-code/low-code front-end development engine introduced in NocoBase 2.0. It combines Models and Flows to simplify front-end logic, enhancing reusability and maintainability. At the same time, it leverages the configurability of Flows to empower front-end components and business logic with no-code configuration and orchestration capabilities.

### All-New 2.0 Pages

We have refactored the basic blocks, fields, and actions, and added Event Flow (Beta) and RunJS (Experimental). This gives you more flexibility and control in interface configuration.

- [RunJS (Experimental Feature)](https://develop.v2.docs.nocobase.com/interface-builder/quickstart)

### AI Employees

AI Employees are "role-based assistants" built into the NocoBase interface. Depending on where you open them, they can understand the page you are on and the current data (such as a list of Leads, Account details, or a form page), and can directly perform tasks like analysis, extraction, translation, retrieval, and configuration suggestions.

> The official CRM Demo comes with pre-configured common AI Employees and tasks, allowing you to [try it out quickly](https://demo.nocobase.com/new) without any setup.

### Multi-app and Multi-workspace

- **Multi-app 2.0**: The database for each application instance is completely independent, ensuring data isolation and security.
- **Multi-workspace**: Achieve multiple independent data spaces within a single application instance through logical isolation.

### History

Introduced a change history tracking feature for collection records, allowing you to easily trace data modification history.

## Plugin 2.0 Support Status

### Open-Source Multi-app Management Plugin is No Longer Maintained

The `@nocobase/plugin-multi-app-manager` plugin implements multi-app management based on a shared process model, where all applications run in the same process. This can lead to mutual blocking between different applications. Therefore, it is not recommended to use this plugin in a production environment. As an alternative, you can deploy each application separately.

### New Mobile Solution

Although NocoBase 2.0 has fully upgraded the desktop experience, the mobile version is still based on 1.x. We will be launching a new mobile solution in the future, so stay tuned.

## Upgrade and Migration Guide

- **For No-Code Users**: NocoBase 1.x and 2.0 are fully compatible. After upgrading, a new "Pages v2" entry will appear in the menu configuration.
- **For Plugin Developers**: The front-end architecture has undergone significant changes. Although 1.x APIs will continue to be supported, it is recommended to use the new development approach to take full advantage of the new features in 2.0.
