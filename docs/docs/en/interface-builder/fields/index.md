# Field

In the UI, a field is a component that serves as a container for unit data. Different data types are represented by different field components. Fields can only be attached to blocks and cannot function independently.

## Fields in a Block

Fields are typically not used independently but exist as child elements within data-type blocks. Data-type blocks usually have a "Configure fields" option, and the list of fields is provided by the current collection.

## Field Designer (Toolbar)

Similar to blocks, the upper right corner of a field component also contains three icons, which are:

- Drag to rearrange
- [Event flow](/interface-builder/event-flow)
- Configuration

## Field Layout

You can customize the field layout within a block by dragging and dropping.

## Field Configuration Options

In addition to general configuration options, different field types support specific configuration options.
