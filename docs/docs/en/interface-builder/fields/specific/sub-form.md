# Sub-form

## Introduction

Sub-forms are suitable for scenarios where you create new associated data before linking it. Multi-level associated data is clearly displayed as a nested form. Compared to the Data Selector and Dropdown components, a sub-form allows you to directly manage the fields of the associated collection within the current page block, and the associated data is submitted along with the main form.

## Usage

### Sub-form for to-many association fields
