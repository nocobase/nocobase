# Title Field

## Introduction

The **Title Field** is typically used in association field components as an identifier for the associated data displayed on the interface. It determines how the main information of the data is presented, usually to help users quickly identify and understand the data.

Different types of title fields correspond to different field components and support corresponding configuration options. For example:

- When the title field is a **Date Field**, the field component uses a **Date component** to display the data.
- When the title field is a **Text Field**, the field component uses a **Text component** to display the data.
- When the title field is an **Option Field**, the field component uses an **Option component** to display the data.
