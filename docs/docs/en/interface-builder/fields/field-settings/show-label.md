# Show Label

## Introduction

Fields in a block display field labels by default to identify the meaning of each field, making it easier for users to read and understand the data content.

In some scenarios (e.g., on display-only pages or when the field meanings are already very clear), you can choose to hide the labels for a cleaner interface. After hiding the labels, only the field values are displayed, and the field names are no longer shown.
