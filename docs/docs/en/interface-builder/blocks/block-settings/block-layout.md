# Layout

## Introduction

Form-like blocks such as Form blocks, Details blocks, and List blocks support layout settings. Layout options include vertical layout (labels and input fields are arranged row by row) and horizontal layout (labels and input fields are placed side by side). Users can adjust the block field layout according to specific needs to ensure that information input or viewing is both clear and efficient.


### Vertical (Default)

The default layout is vertical.

### Horizontal

The horizontal layout places labels and input fields side by side, saving space. Fields with long titles support ellipsis or wrapping.
