# Add Child 

## Introduction

This operation is specifically designed for **tree table blocks** to quickly add child records. When adding a child record, the current row is treated as the parent node, allowing users to easily create child records under any parent. This feature greatly simplifies the management of hierarchical data, making it more efficient and intuitive to expand and organize data structures.
