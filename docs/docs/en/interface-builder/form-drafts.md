# Form Drafts

When form drafts are enabled, the content being filled in is automatically saved locally. Even if the form is accidentally closed or the page is refreshed, the filled data will not be lost.

When a draft exists, a notification will be displayed at the top of the form. The draft will be automatically deleted after successful submission; if it is no longer needed, it can also be manually deleted at any time.

::: tip Tip

Currently, form drafts only support local caching. Future versions will support server-side caching to enable multi-device synchronization.
