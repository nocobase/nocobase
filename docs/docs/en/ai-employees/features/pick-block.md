# Add Context - Block

When chatting with an AI Employee, besides sending files, you can also send application Context information to the AI Employee, allowing the AI Employee to reply based on the application Context information.

### Send Block Information

In the AI Employee Chatbox, click the `Add work context` button in the lower left corner and select `Pick Block`. The application page will enter the Block selection state.
