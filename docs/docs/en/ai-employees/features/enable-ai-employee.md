# Enable AI Employees

NocoBase provides several built-in AI Employees for specific scenarios.

You only need to complete the enabling process in the admin panel to let these digital experts join your business process, realizing automated and intelligent task processing.

## How to Enable

Enter the AI Employee plugin configuration page, click the `AI employees` tab, and enter the AI Employee management page.

You can see that the system already has multiple built-in AI Employees, but none of them are enabled, so you cannot collaborate with these AI Employees on the application page yet.

Select the built-in AI Employee to enable, click the `Edit` button, and enter the AI Employee editing page.

First, in the `Profile` tab, turn on the `Enable` switch.

Then, in the `Model settings` tab, set the Model for the built-in AI Employee:

- Select the LLM Service.
- Select the Model you want to use. Recommended (tested): **gemini-3**, **deepseek-chat**, **qwen3-max**.
