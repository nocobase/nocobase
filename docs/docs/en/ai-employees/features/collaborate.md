# Collaborate with AI Employees

After creating and enabling AI Employees, you can collaborate with them in pages.

## Entry Points

There are two common entry points:

1. **Bottom-right main entry**: Open the AI chat panel from the bottom-right corner of business pages. Suitable for general Q&A and cross-block collaboration.
2. **Block Action entry**: In blocks that support `Actions`, enter via `Actions -> AI employees`. Suitable for tasks on the current block (for example JSBlock scenarios).

## Basic Chat Operations

The chat panel supports common operations such as sending messages, uploading attachments, viewing history, creating new chats, and editing system prompts.

## In-Chat Switching

At the bottom of the input area, you can switch directly:

- `AI Employee Switcher`: switch current employee.
- `Model Switcher`: switch current session model.

Model preferences are saved per employee and restored next time.
