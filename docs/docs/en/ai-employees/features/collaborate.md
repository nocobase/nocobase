# Collaborate with AI Employees

After creating an AI Employee, we can collaborate with our AI Employee on any NocoBase page.

We can open them by clicking an employee avatar in the employee list at the bottom right of the page, and then start collaborating.

You can also pin AI Employees wherever you need them, such as on Tables or Forms, and click them to open the Chatbox.
