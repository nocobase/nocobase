# Web Search

Web Search supplements model knowledge with up-to-date external information.

## How It Works

Web Search availability depends on whether the currently selected model service supports Web Search.

- Supported: search toggle is visible and can be enabled/disabled.
- Not supported: toggle is hidden and search state is reset automatically.

## Use in Chat

Use the search toggle in the sender footer:

- On: AI can search first, then answer.

- Off: AI answers based on existing context only.

## Provider Differences

Web Search capability differs across models. Validate behavior based on your selected model service and model.
