# New AI Employee

If built-in AI Employees do not meet your needs, you can create and customize your own AI Employee.

## Start Creating

Open the `AI employees` management page and click `New AI employee`.

## Basic Profile

Configure the following in the `Profile` tab:

- `Username`: unique identifier.
- `Nickname`: display name.
- `Position`: role description.
- `Avatar`: employee avatar.
- `Bio`: short introduction.
- `About me`: system prompt.
- `Greeting message`: chat greeting.

## Role Setting

In the `Role setting` tab, configure the employee's System Prompt. This content defines the employee's identity, goals, boundaries, and output style during conversations.

Recommended content:

- Role positioning and responsibility scope.
- Task-handling principles and response structure.
- Prohibited behaviors, information boundaries, and tone/style requirements.

You can insert variables (for example current user, current role, current language, and datetime) so the prompt adapts to runtime context.

## Skills and Knowledge

Configure tool permissions in the `Skills` tab. If knowledge base capability is enabled, continue configuration in knowledge-related tabs.

## Complete Creation

Click `Submit` to finish.
