- `Orin`: Data modeling expert
- `Avery`: Form filler
- `Viz`: Insights analyst
- `Lexi`: Translator
- `Nathan`: Frontend code engineer
- `Cole`: NocoBase assistant
- `Vera`: Research analyst

## How to Enable

Go to the AI Employees plugin configuration page, click the `AI employees` tab to enter the AI employee management page.

You can see that the system has multiple built-in AI employees, but none of them are enabled. You cannot collabrate with these AI employees on the application page yet.

### Note

Some built-in AI employees will not appear in the AI employee list in the lower right corner after being enabled. For example, Orin will only appear on the main data configuration page; Nathan will only appear in the JS editor.
