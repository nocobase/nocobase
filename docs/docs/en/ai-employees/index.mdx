## 1. Introduction
> The official CRM Demo comes with pre-configured common AI employees and tasks, allowing for a quick experience with no configuration required.

**AI Employees** are "role-based assistants" built into the NocoBase interface. Depending on where they are opened, they can understand the page you are on and the current data (such as a Leads list, Accounts details, or a form page), and directly perform tasks like analysis, extraction, translation, retrieval, and providing configuration suggestions.


### 1.1. Opening Locations
In the official CRM Demo, you will most often encounter them in these ways:

* **Global panel in the bottom-right corner**: Can be summoned at any time, carrying the current page context for follow-up questions or configuration consultations.

* **Action button in the top-right corner of a block**: For example, clicking **Viz** in the **Leads** list will generate trend charts, stage funnels, and brief conclusions (no prompts required).

* **Specific interfaces**: Such as the front-end engineer **Orin** in the code editor, or the modeling assistant **Nathan** in the bottom-right of the data source configuration page.

### 1.2. Design Philosophy: Roles & Scenarios

Each AI Employee is composed of two parts:
* **A stable role**: Their "personality and expertise," such as Viz's analytical skills or Lexi's linguistic talents. This part is fixed long-term.
* **Flexible tasks**: Task scripts or tools that can be adjusted at any time based on business needs, such as "Analyze this month's sales leads" or "Translate the current form."

This design allows AI Employees to maintain a consistent style while quickly adapting to different business scenarios.

## 2. Scenarios and Usage

> It is recommended to start with "pre-configured tasks" to see the results first before diving into the details.

### 2.1 Viewing Lead Trends and Stages

* **Entry point**: Leads list → **Viz** in the top-right corner of the block
* **Action**: Select a pre-configured task (e.g., "Stage Conversion and Trends," "Source Channel Comparison," "This Month vs. Last Month Review") → Wait for the chart and 2–3 key takeaways.


![Multiple Task Selection](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/00_QuickStart_cn-2025-09-29-16-46-00.png)


* **Diving deeper**: You can ask follow-up questions like "show only East China," "summarize by week," or "exclude self-operated channels."
* **Note**: Viz defaults to "**one chart, one key point.**" If data is insufficient, it will clearly state so instead of fabricating conclusions. Charts are output in standard ECharts JSON format.

### 2.2 Turning Chats/Emails into Form Data

* **Entry point**: Leads → Add Form → **Dex / Lexi** in the action area below the block


![01getting-started-2025-10-27-00-32-51](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/01getting-started-2025-10-27-00-32-51.png)


* **Action**:

  * Dex: Paste the raw text → Execute "Extract and Fill" to automatically identify and write the customer name, contact information, issue type, etc., into the fields.
  * Lexi: Execute "Translate current form content," keeping numerical and date formats unchanged.
* **Note**: If content is missing, it will be flagged, making it easy for manual completion before submission.

### 2.3 Getting a Customer Company Profile

* **Entry point**: An Account's details page → **Vera** in the top-right corner of the block

![01getting-started-2025-10-27-00-35-11](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/01getting-started-2025-10-27-00-35-11.png)

* **Action**: Select the "Company Background and Industry Overview" task → Search the web → Output a summary and a list of key points.
* **Diving deeper**: You can expand on "Recent Developments," "Competitor Comparison," or "Potential Risks."

### 2.4 Encountering Configuration or Permission Issues

* **Entry point**: Global panel in the bottom-right corner → **Cole**
* **Action**: Describe the issue (e.g., "the button is not showing," "who can access this page") → Receive a diagnostic path and recommended actions.
* **Note**: Cole provides diagnostics and action paths but does not directly modify your data or permissions.

## 3. AI Employee Overview and Quick Reference

> This section provides a **complete list + quick links** to avoid repetition with the examples in the main text.

| AI Employee     | Functional Role   | Core Scenarios                       | Applicable Situations               |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| [**Viz**](/ai-employees/built-in/viz)    | Insight Analyst | Business analysis, report generation, trend insight   | When insights are needed from data   |
| [**Orin**](/ai-employees/built-in/data-modeling)   | Data Modeler | Creating/modifying collections, relationship design, index optimization   | When designing or optimizing database structure   |
| [**Dex**](/ai-employees/built-in/form-filler)    | Data Organization Assistant | Text extraction, form filling, information structuring | When handling messy, unstructured information |
| **Lexi**   | Translation Expert   | Multilingual translation, localization, terminology management   | For cross-language communication and document processing   |
| [**Nathan**](/ai-employees/built-in/ai-coding) | Front-end Engineer | Field linkage, component development, form logic   | When implementing front-end interactions and business logic |
| **Cole**   | NocoBase Assistant   | NocoBase configuration guidance, best practices     | "What is/How to use/Why"     |
| **Vera**   | Research Analyst | Competitor analysis, industry research, intelligence gathering   | When external information and market insights are needed |

**Usage Tips**

* **Check the page block first**: Most pages already have an "employee button." Use it first (it's already bound to the context and pre-configured tasks).
* **Start with template tasks**: Run a task to get a visible result before actively asking a second question.
* **Specify the data scope**: For example, "this month/this week, third-party channels only." Viz will generate charts faster and more accurately.

### Conclusion

Start with **Leads → Viz** in our demo and run a pre-configured "Stage Conversion and Trends" task. **First see the results, then ask follow-up questions, and finally explore the configuration**—this is the best rhythm for using AI Employees. If you need to customize or extend, you can proceed to the admin and advanced prompt guides.
