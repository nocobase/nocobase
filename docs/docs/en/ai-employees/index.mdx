# AI Employees · Getting Started

In NocoBase, AI Employees are not chatbots or isolated agents — they are intelligent colleagues seamlessly integrated into your business system, capable of understanding business context and directly executing tasks.

They appear wherever you need them — next to tables, forms, and other components — so you can summon them effortlessly when needed.

You can also summon them from the employee list at the bottom-right corner of the page.

They automatically retrieve data as context — for example, the AI Employee **Viz** beside a table block can access the data within the table and call appropriate tools to process it. This means you no longer need to copy data manually into a chatbot.

They can also automatically understand page structures as context — for instance, **Dex** beside a form block can access the form’s field structure and call the right tools to operate on the page. This means you don’t need to copy data back from a chatbot.

You can also directly select elements on the page and send them to an AI Employee, allowing them to extract the corresponding data and structure automatically.

You can preset tasks for each AI Employee in specific locations, allowing users to trigger them with a single click — no input required.
