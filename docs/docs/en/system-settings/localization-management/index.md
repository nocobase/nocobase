# Localization Management

## Introduction

The Localization Management plugin is designed to assist in managing and implementing the localization process for NocoBase. It translates NocoBase's menus, collections, fields, and all plugins to adapt to the language and culture of a specific region.

## Installation

This is a built-in plugin, so no additional installation is required.

The parts that can be synchronized currently include:

- Local language packs for the system and plugins
- Collection titles, field titles, and field option labels
- Menu titles

After synchronization, it will list all the translatable entries for the current language.
