# Install and Upgrade Plugins

## Built-in Plugins

NocoBase built-in plugins are automatically updated with the core version and require no manual action.

## Commercial Plugins

Please log in to NocoBase Service and refer to the documentation to learn how to install and upgrade commercial plugins.

## Third-party Plugins

Starting from version 2.0, online installation of plugins is no longer supported. Please download the plugin package to your local machine first, then manually upload and extract it to the `./storage/plugins` directory. If the plugin is already enabled, run the following command to complete the plugin upgrade after uploading and extracting.

> ⚠️ **Note**: To avoid cache issues, please ensure that the NocoBase application is stopped before execution.

```bash
yarn nocobase upgrade --skip-code-update
```

### Correct Way to Extract a Plugin

The following example demonstrates how to correctly extract a plugin package to the specified directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /my-nocobase/storage/plugins/@nocobase/plugin-auth-cas && \
  tar -xvzf /downloads/plugin-auth-cas-1.4.0.tgz \
  -C /my-nocobase/storage/plugins/@nocobase/plugin-auth-cas \
  --strip-components=1
```

This command will extract the plugin to the specified directory without an extra `package` directory layer.

```bash
/my-nocobase/storage/plugins/@nocobase/plugin-auth-cas
```
