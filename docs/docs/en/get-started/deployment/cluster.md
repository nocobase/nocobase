# Cluster Deployment

NocoBase supports deploying applications in cluster mode to improve application performance and availability. Cluster deployment allows you to run different instances of the application on multiple servers, or run multiple processes in multi-core mode on a single server.

For details, please refer to the [Cluster Mode](/cluster-mode/) documentation.
