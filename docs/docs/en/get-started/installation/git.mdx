## 4. Set environment variables

The environment variables required by NocoBase are stored in the `.env` file in the root directory. Modify the environment variables according to your actual situation.

TZ=UTC
APP_KEY=your-secret-key
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432

```

:::warning Environment Variable Descriptions

- `TZ` is used to set the application's time zone, which defaults to the operating system's time zone.
- `APP_KEY` is the application's secret key, used for generating user tokens, etc. (If `APP_KEY` is changed, old tokens will become invalid). It can be any random string. Please change it to your own secret key and ensure it is not exposed.
- `DB_*` are database-related. If you are not using the default database service from the example, please modify them according to your actual situation.
