# Overview

The built-in features of the Workflow cannot cover all scenarios. For instance, the built-in node types cannot exhaust every possible operation in all business scenarios. Therefore, we also provide a design for extending the Workflow, including extending trigger and node types. In business scenarios where the built-in features are insufficient, you can extend them using low-code methods.

Extensions are mainly divided into two parts:

- [Extend Trigger Types](./trigger.md)
- [Extend Node Types](./node.md)
