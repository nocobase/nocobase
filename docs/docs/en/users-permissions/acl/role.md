The initially installed application has two built-in roles, "Admin" and "Member", which have different default permission settings.

### Adding, Deleting, and Editing Roles

The role identifier is a unique system identifier; the default role can be customized, but the system's default roles cannot be deleted.

### Setting the Default Role

The default role is the one assigned to a new user when no role is specified.

### Switching Roles

When a user is assigned multiple roles, they can switch between them in My Profile.

The user's default role priority upon entering the system is: The last role switched to (the default role value is updated each time the role is switched) > The first role (system default role).
