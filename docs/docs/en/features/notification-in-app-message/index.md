## Example Usage Scenario

To clarify the use of In-app message, hereâ€™s an example for "Marketing Lead Follow-Up".

Imagine your team is running a major marketing campaign aimed at tracking responses and needs from potential clients. Using in-app messages, you can:

**Set Up a Notification Channel:** Begin by creating a channel called "Marketing Clue" in notification management, making it easy for team members to identify its purpose.

**Configure a Workflow:** Create a workflow that automatically triggers notifications whenever a new lead is generated. Add a notification node to this workflow, select the "Marketing Clue" channel, and customize the message content according to campaign needs. For example:

**Receive Notifications in Real-Time:** Once the workflow triggers, all relevant team members will receive notifications instantly, allowing for quick responses.

**Message Management and Tracking:** In-app messages are grouped by channel name, and you can filter messages by read or unread status to prioritize important information. Clicking "View" redirects you to a configured link, allowing you to manage tasks seamlessly.
