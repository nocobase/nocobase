# Collection selector

The Collection selector field is a special field type that allows users to select one or more collections from a predefined list. This field type is very useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically reference different collections, such as building configurable reports, dashboards, or complex applications that need to change data sources based on user selection.

## Use Cases

### Dynamic Report Generation

In a report generation module, users may need to select a collection from multiple collections as the data source for the report. By using the Collection selector, users can easily select the desired collection, and the system will dynamically generate the report based on the user's selection.

### Configurable Dashboards

In a dashboard application, users can customize the data displayed on the dashboard. The Collection selector allows users to choose the collections they are interested in, thereby displaying charts and statistical data from different data sources on the dashboard.

### Flexible Data Import/Export Tools

When developing a generic data import or export tool, you can use the Collection selector to let users specify the collection to operate on. This way, the same tool can be used to process data from any collection in the system, greatly improving the tool's reusability.
