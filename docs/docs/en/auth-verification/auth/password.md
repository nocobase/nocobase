### Notes

-   The reset link has a time limit and is valid for 120 minutes after being generated by default (configurable by the admin).
-   The link can only be used once and becomes invalid immediately after use.
-   If the user does not receive the reset email, please check if the email address is correct or check the spam folder.
-   The admin should ensure that the mail server is configured correctly to guarantee the successful delivery of reset emails.
