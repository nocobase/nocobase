# @nocobase/dev-config

## 0.1.0-beta.18

### Patch Changes

- 9e48147: The React test preset waits up to 5 seconds for `findBy*` and `waitFor`, instead of Testing Library's 1-second default, so component tests stop failing at random on a busy CI machine. The templates' theme tests wait for the appearance popover's options instead of looking them up the moment it is clicked.

## 0.1.0-beta.17

### Patch Changes

- be0fbbd: The shared ESLint configuration treats calls named `test`, `it` and `describeMigration` as test blocks for `vitest/no-standalone-expect`, so assertions inside a `test` built with `test.extend()` — such as the one `createDatabaseTest()` from `@nocobase/db-testing/vitest` returns, or one a package exports from its own fixtures module — and inside the `up` and `down` callbacks of `describeMigration()` are no longer reported as standalone.
- 299b35a: `createReactVitestConfig()` inlines `@refinedev/react-router`. Loaded by Node, Refine's router bindings got a different copy of `react-router` than the test and the application, so an application rendered under a test's `MemoryRouter` failed with "useLocation() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component". A package's own `server.deps.inline` list is merged with this one.

## 0.1.0-beta.16

### Patch Changes

- e77641b: Rebuild `@nocobase/queue` on BullMQ 6.3.6, with producers, consumers and managers per application

  **Breaking.** `@nocobase/queue` no longer wraps `@boringnode/queue`. `createQueueService(config, { appName, storagePath, logger?, onFallback? })` creates one application's `QueueService`, whose `producer(queue, configKey?)`, `consumer(queue, configKey?)` and `manager(queue, configKey?)` are bound to a named queue:

  - `producer().publish(channel, message, options?)` and `publishMany([{ channel, message }], options?)` write JSON messages with `priority`, `delay`, `attempts`, `backoff` (`fixed` or `exponential`), `removeOnComplete`, `removeOnFail` and a `jobIdProducer`. A batch is prepared entirely before anything is written.
  - `consumer().consume(handler)` registers a handler `(channel, message, signal)` and returns the function that unregisters it once its running calls settle. Every handler of a queue runs for every job; `withChannel(channels, handler)` filters channels.
  - `manager().configure()` changes concurrency, job defaults and the global rate limit at runtime; `drain()` empties waiting jobs; `cancelJob()` and `cancelAllJobs()` cancel jobs this instance runs, without a retry.
  - An `adapter: 'redis'` configuration runs on BullMQ through its public Queue and Worker APIs, each queue under the hash-tagged prefix `nbq:{<digest>}`. `adapter: 'inMemory'` runs in the process and writes unfinished jobs to `storage/queue` when it shuts down; it serves one process. Its optional `queueBackend` names a BullMQ backend factory registered with `registerBackend()`, such as a PostgreSQL one; left out, BullMQ's own Redis backend is used. Redis Cluster is not supported yet.
  - `Job`, `Locator`, `Worker`, `Schedule`, `QueueManager`, `createQueueManager`, `createSyncQueueConfig`, the `sync` and `database` drivers, job discovery, job factories and the OpenTelemetry instrumentation are removed. So is the database driver's migration.

  The `queue` configuration section now has the shape of `jobs`: `default` names a key, and every other key is one complete configuration. Without `queue.default`, queues run on the built-in memory configuration, reported once outside development. A section in the former `connections`/`worker`/`jobs` format is ignored with one warning instead of stopping the application, and its `default` is ignored unless it names a key of the new format.

  `@nocobase/app-server/queue` exports `QueueServiceProvider`, constructed with `{ nodeEnv }`, `queueServiceToken` and `AppQueueConfig`; `QueueProvider`, `queueManagerToken` and `queueJobFactoryRegistryToken` are removed. The provider sets the service up in `start()`, after every provider has booted, and shuts it down last. `planAppRuntimeDatabaseTasks` and `AppRuntimeDatabaseTaskPlanOptions` are removed: planning no longer adds a queue migration source, and `runAppDatabaseTasks` keeps its `runtimeConfig` option. The plugin field `queue: { jobs }` and `createPluginJobLocations()` are deprecated: the field is accepted and ignored, each plugin declaring it is reported once at startup, plugin inspection reports it as the `SERVER_QUEUE_JOBS_DEPRECATED` warning in place of `SERVER_JOB_LOCATION_MISSING`, and `createPluginJobLocations()` returns an empty list.

  The templates compose `QueueServiceProvider`, declare a `memory` and a `redis` key in `server/config/queue.ts`, and drop the `@/jobs` path alias. `create-plugin`'s `server.jobs` capability now generates a `@nocobase/jobs` job and the provider that owns the plugin's `JobExecutor`, instead of a Queue Job; the plugin declares `@nocobase/jobs` as a peer. The Vitest presets no longer inline `@boringnode/queue`. The application development Skill makes `@nocobase/jobs` the default for background work — `JobExecutor` for one-off tasks, `ScheduleExecutor` for recurring ones — and keeps queues for delays, priorities, deduplicating IDs, batches, rate limits and fan-out; the deployment Skill covers the `queue` backend next to the `jobs` one. The queue example plugin now publishes greetings and digest batches and consumes them with two handlers.

  The `queue_jobs` and `queue_schedules` tables of the former database driver, and their migration's history record, are left in place: the migrator only checks packages that still contribute migrations, so startup is unaffected. Drop the tables by hand when nothing reads them. `pnpm nocobase db rollback` refuses to roll back a batch that contains that history record, so it fails while the latest batch is the one that created the tables, as in an application that has applied no migration since.

  Upgrading an application:

  1. In `server/app.ts`, replace `app.addServiceProvider(QueueProvider)` with `app.addServiceProvider(QueueServiceProvider, { nodeEnv: runtime.env.NODE_ENV })`, imported from `@nocobase/app-server/queue`.
  2. Replace `server/config/queue.ts` with configuration keys, such as `memory: { adapter: 'inMemory', persistence: { path: paths.storage('queue') } }` and `redis: { adapter: 'redis', connection: { host, port, db } }`, and set `queue.default` in `config.yml` to the one to run on; an application running more than one instance needs `redis`.
  3. Move each `server/jobs` Job to `@nocobase/jobs`: a `JobExecutor` job registered and set up by the provider that owns it, submitted with `addJob(new Job(payload))`, or a `ScheduleExecutor` rule for recurring work. Use a queue handler registered with `queueServiceToken` in a provider's `boot()`, published with `producer(queue).publish(channel, message)`, only for work that needs a delay, a priority, a deduplicating job ID, a batch, a rate limit or several handlers. Remove `queue: { jobs }` from plugin declarations and `createPluginJobLocations()` from configuration. Jobs still waiting in the former queue storage are not moved.

## 0.1.0-beta.15

### Minor Changes

- dfdd449: ### Typed workflow DSL

  Author workflow definitions with a typed, immutable builder instead of hand-written variable templates.

  `workflow()`, exported from `@nocobase/app-plugin-workflow/dsl`, returns a builder that owns the definition's identity. `addNode()` returns a new builder over its own node list rather than mutating the one it was called on, so chained authoring works as before but code that called `addNode()` for its side effect has to keep the returned builder. `finalize()` rejects a node borrowed from another workflow, a node added to two workflows, and a duplicate node key. Give the `input` or `parameters` surface a TypeBox `Type.*` schema to type it; a raw JSON Schema still describes the surface and leaves it untyped. Workflow and node `options` are typed and validated, and preserved through artifacts and database materialization.

  Handlers are declared with `defineHandler<typeof handler>('./server/handler')` over a type-only import, so evaluating a definition never loads server implementations or their dependencies. A handler reads invocation input, parameters, and upstream results from one shared context rather than from per-node argument mappings, and each node's result type is inferred from its handler's return type and accumulates through the chain, nested branches included. `finalize()` checks that every handler's context requirements are satisfied by the typed surfaces and upstream results.

  The Workflow Skill now explains how to author typed DSL definitions and migrate mapped arguments and JSON Logic conditions to context handlers.

  Conditions now run a handler module that returns a boolean, and the JSON Logic engine is removed along with the `expression` config field and the `evaluateJsonLogic`, `validateJsonLogicExpression`, and `JSON_LOGIC_*` exports. An existing definition that configures `expression` must move that comparison into a handler module. A condition's branches can be declared with the chainable `yes()` and `no()` methods, which reject empty and duplicate branch declarations; generic `branch()` authoring still works.

  `parameters` accepts the same JSON Schema object shape as `inputSchema`, and `compileToFlatIr()` lowers it to the flat declaration map the parameter editor, the value resolver, and the materializer read. The lower-level `defineWorkflow()` API with `RunInstruction.create()` and friends is unchanged and still exported, together with `createReference()` and `lowerBindings()` for its `{{$input.x}}`, `{{$parameters.x}}`, and `{{$nodeResults.key.path}}` templates. A run node that carries no `args` receives the shared handler context, so both authoring styles execute on one engine.

  The examples template's workflows are migrated to the typed builder and read their shared inferred contexts without result casts.

  ### Custom Instruction nodes

  Open the typed workflow builder to application-registered Instructions.

  The builder resolved a node's expression metadata from a table holding `run`, `terminate` and `condition`, so a node of any other type failed with `Unknown workflow instruction`. It now reads the node's own type, configuration and branch structure, which is all the expression needs, and `createNode()` is exported so an extension can supply a node factory beside its Instruction class. The custom Instruction reference documents that factory alongside the existing `defineWorkflow()` form.

  ### Builder validation

  Fail finalization when a workflow builder's `addNode()` result was discarded.

  `addNode()` returns the workflow containing the node, so calling it for its side effect and finalizing the receiver compiled a definition the node was simply missing from — and with it every handler context requirement `finalize()` would otherwise have checked. Types cannot catch this, because the discarded builder is the only value that carries the node. The builder now records what it has claimed and rejects `finalize()` and `compile()` naming each node that was never compiled, including nodes nested in a branch.

  ### Workflow client forms

  Let a workflow revision render its own custom input and parameter forms.

  A workflow package may declare `input.form` and `parameters.form`, resolved inside its own `client/` directory. Those `client` declarations are persisted with the workflow revision and returned by the management API, and the form itself is published under the revision's Artifact hash, so a later build that changes a form cannot change how an already published revision renders. `@nocobase/app-plugin-workflow/vite` exposes those forms to the application build through a virtual module keyed by workflow, revision, and path. In development the module index refreshes when workflow sources change, including added and removed resources, without restarting Vite. Forms get React through bridge exports generated from the installed React modules and the matching host JSX runtimes, so they can use the full React API without bundling a second instance.

  Workflow management addresses unpublished candidates by Artifact hash, so a detail URL identifies one exact version. Hot updates refresh the workflow list and version picker; reopen a changed candidate from there, since an unpublished hash can expire. Materialized revision URLs and mutations stay bound to exact versions. Parameter settings and manual run on a version that has not been materialized yet prompt to enable it first, then navigate to the materialized id. A version that was already materialized stays usable while disabled.

  ### Custom input form schemas

  Hand a custom input form the declarations it is typed for.

  The manual run dialog passed a workflow's raw input schema properties to a custom input form through an `as never` cast, so a form received whatever the schema happened to hold rather than the `string`, `number` and `boolean` declarations `WorkflowParameterFormProps` promises. The properties are now narrowed at that boundary: a property the contract cannot describe is left out instead of being handed over under a type it does not have.

  ### Artifact materialization

  Materialize workflow revisions on demand rather than at startup.

  Startup persists immutable artifact snapshots and publishes client resources, in development as well as production, without creating database revisions. A revision is materialized when a user enables a version, configures its parameters, or runs it manually, and its forms and handlers are resolved from that version's artifact hash. Persisting artifacts, materializing, publishing client resources, and selecting the current version are separate steps: reading parameters and running manually no longer select the current revision, while the first successful parameter save still does. Browser assets are served before the development SPA fallback and restored from persistent storage on startup.

  ### Application workflow layout

  Keep application workflow definitions in a top-level `workflows/` directory and build them to `dist/workflows`.

  Development discovery, `workflow build`, `workflow check`, production artifact loading, and the application Skill all use that location.

  Application server source may now use extensionless relative imports, so a workflow package can import a handler as `./server/calculate-risk`. All three templates set `module: "ESNext"`, `moduleResolution: "Bundler"`, and `tsc-alias.resolveFullPaths: true` in `tsconfig.server.json`: development runs under `tsx`, and the build runs `tsc-alias` after `tsc` to complete the paths for native Node ESM before workflow resources are collected. Workflow source checking and evaluation resolve extensionless handler imports the same way. A workflow package's `client/` form is typechecked and linted as browser code, through the client project rather than the server build.

  `loadAppVitePlugins()` in `@nocobase/dev-config` loads the Vite contribution of every client plugin an application registers, so a template's `vite.config.ts` does not name individual plugins. An application without a `client/plugins.ts` contributes none rather than failing config resolution. A registered package that does not export its `package.json` is read from disk rather than failing config resolution.

  The Workflow Vite contribution refreshes the workflow list and materialized revision picker during development by injecting its module index into the development page. The plugin's published client code no longer imports that index, so an application installing the plugin from a registry no longer fails Vite's dependency pre-bundling with `Could not resolve "virtual:nocobase-workflow-client-entries"`, and an application whose `vite.config.ts` does not call `loadAppVitePlugins()` still builds and runs; it only loses the live candidate refresh. To get it, call `loadAppVitePlugins()` as the templates' `vite.config.ts` does.

  ### Vite source root

  Read a Vite contribution's registration options from the application that registered it.

  `AppVitePluginRegistration.config` was declared but never populated, so the Workflow Vite plugin's configurable `sourceRoot` could not be set by any application and always resolved to the default. `loadAppVitePlugins()` now parses the options literal the application passed to the plugin factory in its `client/plugins.ts`. Only statically writable values are read — an argument that is not a literal object of literal values leaves `config` undefined rather than reporting a partial one, because the declaration is parsed and never executed. `workflow({ sourceRoot })` is the supported way to point the Workflow client build at a directory other than `workflows`; keep it equal to the `sourceRoot` in the application's server workflow configuration.

## 0.1.0-beta.14

### Minor Changes

- 46ce11f: A build is no longer tied to a mount path. `createAppViteConfig` builds with a relative base, and the application server rewrites the relative URLs in `index.html` — the `./assets/` chunks and every `public/` file the page references — to the path it is mounted at, so one `dist/` runs at any `APP_BASE_PATH`. The development server still needs an absolute base and refuses to start without `APP_BASE_PATH`, which `pnpm dev` always passes; `DEFAULT_APP_BASE_PATH` in `@nocobase/app-server/support` is the `/main` it falls back to. In proxy mode, `createDevClientConfigPlugin` from `@nocobase/app-cli/dev/proxy` renders the remote application's client configuration into the local page, and says which status or redirect it met when the remote does not serve one.

  `pnpm build` records `nocobase.relocatable: true` in `dist/package.json` in place of `nocobase.basePath`, and no longer copies `APP_BASE_PATH` into `dist/.env`. app-installer chooses the mount path with `install --base-path` and keeps it in `app.env`, and a Hub archive keeps `/hub` unless the flag says otherwise; an archive from an earlier build runs only at the path it records, and `install`, `upgrade` and `rollback` refuse it elsewhere with `BASE_PATH_MISMATCH`. The Hub refuses such an archive unless it was built for `/<appId>`. The template Dockerfiles no longer take `APP_BASE_PATH` as a build argument: the image defaults to `/main`, `/hub` for the Hub, and `docker run -e APP_BASE_PATH` moves it.

- 46ce11f: `@nocobase/app-portal-sdk` is removed; nothing in an application depends on it any more. The presets named after it are renamed: `@nocobase/dev-config/vite/portal` and `createPortalViteConfig` are `@nocobase/dev-config/vite/app` and `createAppViteConfig`, and `createPortalConfig` is `createApplicationConfig`. The application ESLint preset now reports any `import.meta.env` read other than `PROD`, `DEV` and `MODE`, since browser code takes runtime values from the client configuration. The i18n and file plugin Skills no longer refer to the Portal SDK.

## 0.1.0-beta.13

### Minor Changes

- ec92b20: The shared ESLint presets hold commands under `cli/` to the application command line's contract. Importing `@nocobase/app-server/node`, calling `process.cwd()`, writing with `console.log`, and calling `this.exit()` or `this.logJson()` are errors there, and each message names what to use instead: `withApp()`, `this.rootDir` or an `appPath()` flag, `this.log` and a returned result, or `CommandError`.

## 0.1.0-beta.12

### Patch Changes

- 9e8fc3e: Export `createShadcnRegistryConfig(root)` from `@nocobase/dev-config/eslint`. It returns the shadcn/ui registry relaxations `createPortalConfig` applies to `client/`, scoped to another directory, so a package whose primitives live elsewhere applies the same list instead of copying it.
- cde9a8e: Describe the monorepo's Skill links correctly in the comment on the ESLint Skills ignore patterns. The ignored paths are unchanged.

## 0.1.0-beta.11

### Patch Changes

- 56613b2: Relax the rules shadcn/ui registry output trips over in `createPortalConfig`, for `client/components/ui/**/*.tsx`, `client/hooks/use-mobile.ts` and the recharts payloads in `client/components/ui/chart.tsx`.

  `shadcn add` copies these files from the upstream registry verbatim, and `shadcn add <name> --diff` is only meaningful while the local copy matches, so rules such as `react-refresh/only-export-components` report on a shape nobody here chose and whose only available fix is the edit that destroys the diff. Putting the exception in the factory rather than in each `eslint.config.js` means every portal that adds a registry component gets it — the applications generated from the templates included — instead of each one discovering the same failure and writing the same block. Everything outside those paths, `client/components/` included, is held to the full rule set, and a portal can still override the relaxation through `overrides`.

- fc34a66: Exclude `.agents/skills/` and `.claude/skills/` from ESLint and Prettier. Skills are prose written for agents to read rather than source to reflow, an application's copies are replaced wholesale by `skills:sync`, and `.claude/skills/` holds symbolic links into `.agents/skills/` — so formatting through one checked the same file twice and wrote the result back into the directory it points at.

## 0.1.0-beta.10

### Patch Changes

- fe564d9: Transform the queue loader in both Vitest presets so dynamically discovered TypeScript jobs load through the test runtime instead of Node's strip-only loader. Document the shared preset requirement for application job-discovery tests.

## 0.1.0-beta.9

### Patch Changes

- 5f92529: Render DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX locally in the editable file Registry components using lazily loaded OOXML viewers and existing content URLs. Preserve legacy Office Online fallback and viewer WASM asset paths in Portal development. Existing applications must merge the updated Registry source and install its declared dependency.

  Correct the file Skill read-field policy for queried records used by Registry UI, and document viewer installation, Vite configuration, content authentication boundaries, and preview verification.

  Demonstrate browser-local DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX previews in the file and order attachment examples, with local-network requirements and download-only legacy format guidance.

## 0.1.0-beta.8

### Patch Changes

- 26ac480: Add code-defined Cron scheduling with timezone support, transactional synchronization, and stable schedule identities. Applications and plugins register schedules with `SchedulerService.defineSchedule(definition)` and execution targets with `registerTarget()` during provider registration or boot.

  Route scheduled jobs and workers through the application's configured logical queue, with an adapter-neutral schedule store. Keep the upstream queue dependency unmodified and store queue and scheduler timestamps compatibly with their adapters while preserving absolute instants.

  Move queue storage migrations from Scheduler into the queue library, which resolves configured database connections and physical tables. Assemble these sources centrally in app-server for startup and CLI commands, rejecting overlapping active queue tables before execution. Support immutable target parameters, shared migration history and locks, upstream-compatible physical schemas, and read-only execution conditions that leave skipped migrations unapplied.

  Track idempotent occurrences through the target's final outcome, including asynchronous Workflow completion and recovery with stable run references. Target registration returns a completion-reporting handle scoped to that target; long-running executions can report completion without a fixed scheduler observation timeout.

  Provide an authorized, read-only schedule management page and API with paginated schedules, trigger counts, execution history, and separate schedule and execution statuses. Register `pnpm nocobase schedule sync` as a global CLI command and integrate it into all application templates.

  Include application examples for custom task targets and scheduled Workflows, and agent guidance for schedule definition, target selection, asynchronous execution, diagnostics, and recovery.

  Keep the database manifest CLI entry available before compilation so fresh workspace installs link the command required by package builds.

  Declare the OpenTelemetry dependencies referenced by the upstream queue declarations so consumers can typecheck published Server APIs without enabling tracing or skipping library checks.

## 0.1.0-beta.7

### Minor Changes

- a60decd: Require an explicit absolute baseDir for Server plugins and resolve migrations, seeds, jobs, and package metadata from the loaded plugin copy. Generate and validate database task manifests during builds so TypeScript and JavaScript share source checksums, with verified legacy JavaScript history conversion and synchronized plugin scaffolding and application templates.

## 0.1.0-beta.6

### Patch Changes

- 73f7538: Resolve a Portal build's asset URLs from the runtime base path so a build keeps working when a host mounts it under a different prefix. Vite inlined the build-time `base` into its `__vitePreload` helper, and that helper awaits every stylesheet link it inserts, so a lazy chunk carrying its own CSS rejected its dynamic import and rendered the route's error state once the application was served from somewhere other than the prefix it was built for.

  The templates each carried their own copy of this fix, added before it existed in the shared configuration. They now inherit it from `createPortalViteConfig` instead. A consumer that configures `experimental.renderBuiltUrl` itself still overrides the shared one, so nothing that needs its own strategy loses it — the templates simply no longer need one.

## 0.1.0-beta.5

### Patch Changes

- ec576ba: Let plugins contribute commands to an application's CLI, and rename the bin to `nocobase`.

  An application now has a `cli/` composition root beside `client/` and `server/`. Its `cli/index.ts` calls `runAppCli()` from `@nocobase/nb3-cli/runtime`, which assembles one command tree from three sources: the built-in plugin management commands under `plugin`, the application's own commands under `app`, and each registered plugin's commands under the topic that plugin declares. `pnpm nocobase` runs it.

  A plugin contributes commands by exporting a `./cli` entry that calls `defineCliPlugin()` with a topic and a map of oclif `Command` subclasses. `@nocobase/app-plugin-cli-example` is the reference implementation. `@oclif/core` is a peer dependency of such a plugin so that the plugin and the application share one copy, which is what keeps help rendering and flag parsing consistent.

  `plugin register`, `plugin unregister`, and `plugin inspect` maintain `cli/plugins.ts` the same way they already maintain `client/plugins.ts` and `server/plugins.ts`, keyed on whether the plugin exports `./cli`. An application without TypeScript degrades to printed instructions for that file exactly as it does for the other two.

  `cli/` is compiled into `dist`, so a deployed application runs the same commands with `node ./cli/index.js`. The application's own `migrate` and `seed` are now commands rather than separate scripts, and `pnpm migrate` / `pnpm seed` dispatch through the CLI — the script names are unchanged. A command that cannot work in a deployment goes in `cli/dev-commands/`, which the build excludes; client inspection lives there because it needs Vite and the browser client. `server:config` was removed outright.

  Two breaking changes come with this. The bin is `nocobase` rather than `nb3`, and the five plugin commands moved from `app plugin *` to the top-level `plugin *`, which frees the `app` topic for the commands an application writes itself. The `pnpm plugin:*` script names are unchanged, so anything invoking those scripts is unaffected.

## 0.1.0-beta.4

### Patch Changes

- 813da59: Require eslint-plugin-react-refresh 0.5.6, which restores the member-expression check that 0.5.5 dropped. Under 0.5.5 an aliased component export such as `const Select = SelectPrimitive.Root` was reported as a non-component export, so a freshly generated application failed `pnpm lint` on an untouched shadcn/ui file.

## 0.1.0-beta.3

### Minor Changes

- 174eab5: Consolidate the browser packages into `@nocobase/app-client`.

  `@nocobase/app-sdk` is gone; its API client now lives in `@nocobase/app-client` and is imported from there. `@nocobase/app-portal-sdk` is deprecated and keeps only what still has consumers: `NocoBaseClient` and the runtime configuration it reads, which exist to reach a v2 NocoBase server, and the route surface containers under `/routing`. Its ACL, auth, data, extension, i18n, and system-settings modules are removed, as is the route tree that `/routing` used to export alongside the surfaces.

  `@nocobase/app-client` gains `resolveAppBase()`, which reports the path the application is mounted at.

  Four plugins built their API client at import time instead of resolving it from the application's service container, so they could not see `api.baseURL` from the application configuration. They now resolve it, which means an application that configures a base URL gets one client rather than two that disagree.

  The injected browser global `NOCOBASE_PORTAL_BASE` is renamed to `APP_BASE_PATH`. Its value has always been the `APP_BASE_PATH` environment variable, and the old name grouped it with the settings that address a v2 NocoBase server. Those keep their names. A client and the server that serves it must be upgraded together.

  `@nocobase/app-plugin-data-provider` is removed. It forwarded the Portal data provider, and applications built on the current client runtime do not use it.

  The Hub template is rebuilt from the default template and now runs the same client and server stack as every other v3 application. Its `/api/apps` endpoint and its v2 API proxy are gone, so a hub's `.env` no longer configures them.

  The Portal SDK's template compatibility check is removed with the rest: it had been disabled behind a constant, and its install script cost every generated project a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `allowBuilds` entry it did not need. `createPortalViteConfig` no longer takes the plugin that injected it.

### Patch Changes

- 174eab5: Keep `dist` readable while it rebuilds. The build deleted the directory before compiling, so a package linting in parallel could fail to resolve `@nocobase/dev-config/eslint` during that window. The output is now staged and swapped in once compilation succeeds, which also leaves the last good build in place when compilation fails.
- 02876d6: Raise the shared Vitest `testTimeout` and `hookTimeout` to 30 seconds. Vitest's 5-second default is a local-machine number: CI runs every package's suite in parallel on one shared runner, so work that finishes in under a second on a developer's machine can take several seconds there. A test that grows legitimately then fails as a timeout on CI long before it is slow enough to notice locally. A package that needs a different value still sets its own, which continues to take precedence over the shared one.

## 0.0.1-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- fb1a752: Make the shared service-provider runtime environment-neutral and add a matching universal ESLint configuration for libraries that do not depend on Node, browser, or React globals.

## 0.0.1-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- b049266: Add language switching on top of `@nocobase/app-i18n`. Applications and plugins declare their locales the same way on both sides, the browser loads only the language it is showing, and the chosen one is kept in storage and mirrored to the server session.
