# @nocobase/app-plugin-users

## 1.0.0-beta.12

### Major Changes

- db16945: Toasts go through a toaster that `@nocobase/app-client` defines and the application implements, so code that reports a result no longer depends on how toasts are rendered.

  - **App client.** `useToaster()` returns the application's `Toaster`. Its `show({ type, title, description, action, duration, id, onClose })` returns an id that `close(id)` takes, and `resolveToaster(app.services)` returns the same toaster outside React. The application registers the implementation under `toasterToken`; `@nocobase/app-client` registers none. Without one, nothing throws: each toast is logged to the console instead, an error toast as an error, and the first says how to register a toaster. Clicking a toast's action runs its `onClick` and leaves the toast open.
  - **Templates.** `client/lib/toaster.ts` forwards toasts to the Base UI `toast` manager that the mounted `Toaster` renders, and decides their presentation for the whole application: an error written as plain text is announced at once, while one with an action, or with an element for its title or description, keeps the default priority. `client/service-provider.ts` registers it in `register()`. The account menu, the language switcher and the Examples route overlay demo show their toasts through `useToaster()`.
  - **Plugins (breaking).** Hub, Users, Workflow and AI employee pages report through `useToaster()` instead of `Toast.useToastManager()` from `@base-ui/react/toast`, and no longer choose a toast's priority. They need the `@nocobase/app-client` that exports it, and the application has to register a toaster: without one nothing throws, but their toasts only reach the console, and a Hub page whose only content is an error shows nothing. They no longer require a Base UI `Toast.Provider`.
  - **Skills.** The frontend references and each affected plugin's Skill describe `useToaster()`, and the `nocobase-app-upgrade` edge case "Notifications and the application toaster" replaces "Notifications and the Base UI toast".

  Upgrade an existing application with the `nocobase-app-upgrade` Skill, which brings `client/lib/toaster.ts` and its registration together with the new `@nocobase/app-client` and plugin ranges; follow the same steps when upgrading by hand. `pnpm nocobase plugin update` is not enough on its own: the plugins stay inside the application's `^1.0.0-beta` ranges, so it installs them, but it leaves `@nocobase/app-client` where it is, and their pages then fail to load for want of `useToaster`.

## 1.0.0-beta.11

### Major Changes

- 2217eb2: Remove `@nocobase/app-plugin-notification-provider` and show every notification through the Base UI toast the templates already ship. The package is no longer published, and Sonner is no longer a dependency of anything.

  - **Templates.** `client/react-providers.ts` mounts the `Toaster` from `client/components/ui/toast.tsx` once, in the `application` layer, and the account menu and language switcher call `toast.add` from `@/components/ui/toast`. A rule at the end of `client/styles.css` lifts the toast viewport above dialogs and sheets, which share its `z-50`. The plugin and `sonner` leave `client/plugins.ts` and `package.json`, and no Refine notification provider is registered.
  - **Plugins (breaking).** Hub, Users, Workflow and AI employee pages report through `Toast.useToastManager()` from `@base-ui/react/toast` instead of Sonner or Refine's `useNotification()`, so they now require the application to mount a Base UI `Toast.Provider`; without one their pages fail with `Base UI: useToastManager must be used within <Toast.Provider>`. They move to `1.0.0` for that reason, which keeps an existing application's `^0.1.0` ranges, and so `pnpm nocobase plugin update`, from installing them before the toaster is in place. Hub notifications appear where the application's toaster places them rather than top-right. `sonner` and `@refinedev/core` are no longer peers.
  - **Skills.** The frontend references describe `toast.add` from `@/components/ui/toast` in place of Sonner, and each affected plugin's Skill names the toaster requirement and the error that reveals it.

  Upgrade an existing application by moving to this template release with the `nocobase-app-upgrade` Skill, which brings the new plugin ranges together with the toaster. Its "Notifications and the Base UI toast" edge case (`packages/app/app-skills/skills/nocobase-app-upgrade/references/edge-cases.md`) lists the steps, their order, and how to verify the pages afterwards; follow the same steps when upgrading by hand.

### Patch Changes

- dbf5631: Replace guidance that named removed commands and layouts. The Hub's development page names the archive `nocobase build --tar` actually writes, `storage/exports/dist.tar.gz`. The scheduler Skill synchronizes with `pnpm nocobase scheduler sync` instead of `nb3 schedule:sync` and gives the deployed form, `node dist/cli/index.js scheduler sync --finalize`. The repository example applies its migrations and seeds with `nocobase db apply`, the CLI example's Skill matches its manifest and the stdout-only `--json` contract, and the i18n Skill no longer presents `pnpm i18n:check` as the monorepo form of `locales check`. Plugin `AGENTS.md` files carry the current dependency rules from the plugin template.

## 0.1.0-beta.10

### Patch Changes

- c8ddd7d: Consolidate the authorization API. Resource types are either catalog types (`settings`, `composite`, `database.collection`), whose items and actions must be registered, or record types (`page`, `user`, `notification`, `hub.app`, `hub.host`), which declare type-level actions and judge each record; there are no `*` items. Business resources become composite resources, a built-in core mechanism: every Authorization has `authz.compositeResources` (which replaces `authz.business`) and reserves the `composite` resource type, so `businessPlugin()` is gone with no replacement and `resourceTypes.add({ type: 'composite' })` throws; `defineBusinessResource` is `defineCompositeResource`, every `Business*` type is `CompositeResource*` (`CompositeResource`, `CompositeResourceBuilder`, `CompositeResourceActionBuilder`, `CompositeResourceReference`, `CompositeResourceConditions`, `CompositeResourceApi`, `BindableCompositeResourcePermission` and so on) and the grant policy is `{ type: 'composite', scopes }`. Resource types carry no `title`: they are never displayed, and the library holds no translation keys. A composite composes exactly the grants its definition lists, on any type except another composite. A data scope no longer names a `collection`: it targets the one resource its grant actions address (`dataScopeTarget(action, key)`), whose type must declare `recordAccess: true` on `resourceTypes.add`, as `database.collection` does; `define` checks this when the type is registered, and `authz.compositeResources.validate()` and first use check types registered later. The library holds no display concepts. `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization` provides `authz.ui`, also exposed to plugin setup contexts: `ui.sections.add` for the top-level sections `pages`, `business` and `administration` and one level of subsections (with `extend: true` for a subsection another plugin owns, as workflow owns `automation` and scheduler extends it), `ui.groups.add` for right-side groups, `ui.place(ref, { section, group? })`, and `ui.defaultSection(type, section)`. `pagesPlugin` registers the `pages.page` subsection, the only one the client fills, from its route tree. The client no longer remaps the `@nocobase/authorization` namespace. `authz.settings.add` no longer takes `section`; settings items and composites are placed with `authz.ui.place`, and unplaced ones land in their type's default section "Other". Startup validation runs after every provider has booted and reports unknown subsections and groups, placements of unregistered resources and unfit data scopes, throwing in development and logging a warning in production. A resource holds at most one default-access rule: the table is unique on `(resourceType, resourceId)` as well as `key`, and a second rule raises `DefaultAccessConflictError`, answered with 409. `authorizationToken` is the only service token: `permissionSetsToken` is gone, `authz.db` is now `authz.database`, settings items are registered with `authz.settings.add` and checked with semantic actions, and rule plugins build on `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization/server/extension`. The client exposes `AuthorizationClient.snapshot/revision/invalidate/onInvalidated` and renamed management components. Every client page route must now declare `authz` (a check or `'skip'`); nothing is inferred from the route name. The authorization migrations and seeds were edited in place, including the new `key` column on default-access rules, so existing databases must be reset and reinstalled. A stored composite grant that no longer expands — an unknown action or data scope, an invalid scope value or policy — is skipped for that grant alone instead of failing every check of the identity: it permits nothing, a direct check of its action denies with `INVALID_GRANT`, and `createAuthorization({ onInvalidGrant })` is told once, which the application plugin logs; `authz.compositeResources.validateGrant` explains a stored grant, and the plugin's startup validation scans every stored Permission Set, throwing in development and warning in production. `authz.database.collections.add` treats a re-registration with the same actions as a no-op even when its title or description differ, keeping the first and reporting a startup warning through `collections.warnings()`; only different actions throw. `authz.resourceTypes.get(type).items.add(item)` remains the generic low-level item registration that `settings.add`, `database.collections.add` and `compositeResources.define` build on.

### Patch Changes

- 441a3ef: Remove the legacy Viewer Hub role and keep filter labels on one line

  The Hub role picker offered a third option, `hub-viewer`, that was already
  impossible to assign: it rendered as a locked row explaining that the
  assignment was protected. It only existed to keep older installations
  readable, and the Hub has no such installations, so the role is gone. The
  picker now offers the two roles that can actually be assigned, and a new
  migration deletes the Permission Set together with its assignments.
  `HUB_ACTIVE_ROLE_KEYS` disappears with it, because it only existed to name
  the subset of `HUB_PERMISSION_SET_KEYS` that excluded the legacy role.

  `SelectValue` also stretched its trigger instead of staying on one line, so
  "All permission sets" wrapped to two lines and overflowed the fixed-height
  control on the Users page. It now truncates, and the permission set filter is
  wide enough to show its own default label.

## 0.1.0-beta.8

### Patch Changes

- 80ef702: Match the user search as literal text, and stop reporting server faults as invalid input.

  `UserAdministrationService.list` now reads through the Repository, whose `includes` treats the search term as literal text: `%` and `_` typed into the user search box mean themselves instead of acting as SQL wildcards, where `%` previously listed every account. The page is ordered by creation time with `id` as a tiebreaker, so accounts created in the same instant cannot repeat or disappear between pages.

  The `/api/users` routes answer `400 INVALID_USER_INPUT` only for their own request parsing. A `TypeError` raised anywhere else, such as a defect in a registered `UserRoleScope`, is no longer returned to the caller as invalid input carrying an internal message; it surfaces as a server error.

## 0.1.0-beta.7

### Patch Changes

- d696700: Give every settings surface the token that matches what it is, so panels stop disagreeing with one another.

  The permission set editor is where this shows: its two tabs sit in one panel, and the permission configuration tab painted itself `bg-background` while the assignment tab inherited the panel's `bg-card`, so switching tabs changed the page colour under the same heading. The same mistake is spread across the settings pages, and none of it is visible under a preset whose page and card are near-identical.

  Each token names a layer rather than a shade, and every site now uses the one that describes it. A panel resting on the page is `bg-card`, which is what the AI tools and skills pages already used while the LLM service, MCP service, conversation, API key, user and notification log panels named the page surface instead — two lists in one plugin, one framed and one flat. A dialog or drawer is `bg-popover`, which is what the shared `Sheet`, `Dialog` and `Popover` primitives use and what six hand-rolled drawers and dialogs did not. An opaque sticky header, footer or table head names the surface it scrolls within rather than the page behind it. A form control names no surface at all and inherits the one it sits on, the way the shared `Input` and `Textarea` do with `bg-transparent`; twenty hand-rolled inputs, selects and text areas were pinned to the page colour and showed through as a differently coloured box inside every card.

  The styling reference now states which token describes which layer, and why picking one because it happens to look right is what puts a page-coloured block inside a panel.

### Minor Changes

- 64b3fdb: Support registered authorization subject selectors with permission-checked search, pagination, and name resolution. Share the dynamic picker across permission-set assignments, sharing rules, and restriction rules, and integrate the existing user service.

### Patch Changes

- 64b3fdb: Separate authorization services from application integration: the library provides decisions, permission-set and access-rule services, store contracts and handlers; the application plugin owns database adapters, migrations, identities and management UI.

  Add configurable root and default permission sets, protected-set metadata, transaction-bound service APIs, and integration with user management and Hub roles. Add database authorization for explicitly registered collections through Repository policies, plus a runnable example plugin.

  Provide a permission-set workspace with routed editing and user assignments, nested resource groups, field and record-scope controls, and a permission inspector. Localize management UI and request-specific resource labels. Application routes may declare signed-in access without a page grant.

  Migration ownership changes inline the existing table definitions in the application plugin. This changes the checksums of previously executed migrations; upgrade compatibility must be resolved before deploying to an existing database.

- 64b3fdb: Separate business resource declarations from underlying handler registration through `resourceTypes`. Remove transitional registration aliases and legacy title decoding. Store rule record IDs directly in each action's JSON, preserving independent named scopes without auxiliary record tables. Initialize the sales example and Hub permission titles directly in their final form, without development-version upgrade scripts.
- 64b3fdb: Integrate source-qualified database authorization and native relation policies with AI data services. Preserve explicit route group extensions, translated resource search, Hub ownership checks, API key cleanup, and protected permission-set assignments across user deletion. Update shared application guidance for the split authorization plugins.
- 64b3fdb: Separate permission-set assignment management from CRUD, use one configure permission for default access, and register an independent permission inspector with its own options and subject selection endpoints. Reflect the operations in management controls and the user inspection shortcut.
- 64b3fdb: Add composed business operations with named data scopes and categorized business and administration groups. Permission and rule editors expose only this catalog; page, collection and custom resource handlers remain internal authorization targets.

  Enforce per-operation default access, sharing and restriction scopes while preserving field permissions. Return resolved underlying decisions and repository policies for inspection and execution.

  Use translation descriptors for permission titles, integrate permission-set assignments into user management, and demonstrate independent project, quote and order scopes with direct and team-based assignments.

- 64b3fdb: Remove Refine from client authorization checks. Use `AuthorizationClient.can({ resource, action })` instead of the removed two-argument signature, and import `useCan` from `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization/client`. Migrate page guards, navigation, and notification visibility while preserving session isolation and realtime permission invalidation.

  Remove the Refine access-control configuration and legacy global authorization client accessors. Resolve the application-owned client through `useAuthorizationClient()` or `authorizationClientToken`. Settings actions now revoke stale access immediately; route checks no longer bypass the authorization page or translate Refine CRUD action names.

  Unify route authorization under `authz: 'skip' | { resource: { type, id }, action }`. Normalize default rules during registration and share them across page guards, navigation, permission discovery, and inspection. Remove the legacy `access` field and string resource adapter.

  Limit settings action checks to the actions each page uses, keep the permission-set action helper internal, and avoid rebuilding navigation twice when selecting a route.

- 64b3fdb: Move default user permission-set integration into the Users plugin and remove duplicated template providers. Add application-owned preset title metadata for client-side localization without overwriting custom names. Preserve Hub's custom role scope and share searchable assignment selection between user creation and editing.
- 64b3fdb: Replace inline user permission editing with a searchable drawer that previews changes and saves them together. Clarify permission-set terminology and show compact direct-assignment summaries.

Declare their production providers in all application templates so deployments with automatic peer installation disabled retain the required runtime packages. Document the provider contract for generated plugins.

  Existing applications upgrading these packages must add compatible versions of their required shared peers to production dependencies: @nocobase/db, @nocobase/service-provider, @nocobase/repository-input, @nocobase/authorization, @nocobase/caching, @nocobase/i18n, and @nocobase/queue for the standard server stack, plus @nocobase/ai-employee when using its plugin.

### Patch Changes

- e3fa827: Add reusable user administration and Hub-scoped role-based authorization. Authentication now supports disabled accounts, transaction-aware administration, stable duplicate-identity conflicts, Session revocation, and immediate Realtime disconnects. Authorization supports protected Permission Sets, atomic scoped assignment replacement, and Client permission invalidation. The Users page supports protected role options, readable multi-role editing, explicit unassigned states, and a distinction between direct roles and authenticated-user defaults; password reset and database Session revocation share one transaction. The default App exposes its direct Authorization Permission Sets as application roles while keeping System administrator changes in Authorization. The Hub defines Administrator, Operator, and Viewer roles, batch-loads their user assignments, enforces every Hub and user-management action on the server, protects the final enabled Administrator, and hides unauthorized Client controls. Both templates register the reusable Users plugin; Hub exposes Applications, User management, and a read-only role matrix directly in its control-plane navigation, while the default App keeps Users in Settings. Only the Hub template receives Hub roles, disables public sign-up, and omits ordinary App Settings, workflows, notifications, and example plugins.
