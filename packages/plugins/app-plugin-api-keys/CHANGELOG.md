# @nocobase/app-plugin-api-keys

## 0.1.0-beta.9

### Patch Changes

- 41f478f: Cite `lucide-react` instead of `sonner` as the example client peer in the plugin `AGENTS.md`, since plugins report toasts through the application and no longer depend on `sonner`.
- Updated dependencies [db16945]
  - @nocobase/app-client@1.0.0-beta.23
  - @nocobase/app-plugin-authentication@1.0.0-beta.24

## 0.1.0-beta.8

### Patch Changes

- 02d5402: `@nocobase/app-cli` is now the whole application command line: it provides the `nocobase` bin and absorbs `@nocobase/nb3-cli` (command assembly, the plugin contract, plugin and Skill management) and `@nocobase/app-tools` (`dev`, `build`, `start`, `server-deps`). Neither of those two packages is published any more, and there is no compatibility period.

  - **Commands.** Standard commands leave the `app` topic: `nocobase db apply`, `nocobase config init`, `nocobase collections generate`. `app db doctor` is now `collections doctor`, `app i18n:check` is now `locales check`, and `app upload`/`app deploy` are `release upload`/`release deploy`, registered only when `package.json` sets `nocobase.cli.publishing: true`. New commands `dev`, `build`, `start`, `dist retarget` and `dist check` replace the application's `scripts/*.mjs`. `plugin skills sync` and `plugin cli-hooks` are removed; use `skills sync`. `app` now holds only an application's own commands.
  - **Discovery.** Commands are found by path: an application's `cli/commands/orders/sync.ts` answers to `nocobase app orders sync`, with no index to maintain. The bin finds the application from the nearest `package.json` (`nocobase.templateKind` for a source checkout, `nocobase.buildTarget` for a built `dist/`), or from `NOCOBASE_APP_ROOT`; applications no longer have a `cli/index.ts`. A built-in command runs without importing the application's plugins.
  - **Plugins.** A plugin's topic is its package name without the scope and `app-plugin-` prefix, so the scheduler's commands move from `schedule` to `scheduler` and the CLI example's from `demo` to `cli-example`. `defineCliPlugin` accepts `devCommands`, which a built `dist/` leaves out; the workflow plugin's `check` and `build` are development commands. Plugins declare `@nocobase/app-cli` as their peer instead of `@nocobase/nb3-cli`.
  - **Deployment.** `nocobase build` writes `dist/cli/index.js`, so `node dist/cli/index.js db apply` runs from any directory without pnpm; `dist/package.json` keeps only the `start` and `nocobase` scripts. The `migrate` and `seed` scripts it used to generate pointed at commands that no longer existed and are gone. Development tooling (`typescript`, `tsx`, `vite`, `prettier`, `tar`, `@nocobase/dev-config`) is an optional peer, so a deployment installs none of it.
  - **Templates.** Scripts are reduced to `postinstall`, `dev`, `build`, `start` and the quality checks; every other command is `pnpm nocobase <topic> <command>`. `scripts/`, `cli/index.ts` and `cli/commands/index.ts` are removed.

  Upgrading an existing application requires moving to the new layout in one step: see "Shared application scripts and commands" in the `nocobase-app-upgrade` Skill (`packages/app/app-skills/skills/nocobase-app-upgrade/references/edge-cases.md`) for the full procedure. Messages that named `nocobase app db repair` and similar commands now name the new ids.

- ec92b20: Plugin commands are `AppCommand`s and print the command envelope under `--json`. `scheduler sync` creates the application through `withApp()`, so it acts on the application the runner located rather than the current directory and always destroys the runtime. `workflow build` path flags are `appPath()` flags, so their defaults resolve against the application root from any directory. The CLI example's `artifact build` is a development command, and `pnpm plugin:create --with cli` generates an `AppCommand` with a test that uses `@nocobase/app-cli/testing`.

  The application Skill gains a reference on adding an application command, and the application templates and plugin `AGENTS.md` files describe commands in those terms: a command returns its result, throws `CommandError`, and creates the application with `withApp()` when it needs it. The templates import the CLI authoring API from `@nocobase/app-cli`.

- dbf5631: Replace guidance that named removed commands and layouts. The Hub's development page names the archive `nocobase build --tar` actually writes, `storage/exports/dist.tar.gz`. The scheduler Skill synchronizes with `pnpm nocobase scheduler sync` instead of `nb3 schedule:sync` and gives the deployed form, `node dist/cli/index.js scheduler sync --finalize`. The repository example applies its migrations and seeds with `nocobase db apply`, the CLI example's Skill matches its manifest and the stdout-only `--json` contract, and the i18n Skill no longer presents `pnpm i18n:check` as the monorepo form of `locales check`. Plugin `AGENTS.md` files carry the current dependency rules from the plugin template.

## 0.1.0-beta.7

### Patch Changes

- c8ddd7d: Consolidate the authorization API. Resource types are either catalog types (`settings`, `composite`, `database.collection`), whose items and actions must be registered, or record types (`page`, `user`, `notification`, `hub.app`, `hub.host`), which declare type-level actions and judge each record; there are no `*` items. Business resources become composite resources, a built-in core mechanism: every Authorization has `authz.compositeResources` (which replaces `authz.business`) and reserves the `composite` resource type, so `businessPlugin()` is gone with no replacement and `resourceTypes.add({ type: 'composite' })` throws; `defineBusinessResource` is `defineCompositeResource`, every `Business*` type is `CompositeResource*` (`CompositeResource`, `CompositeResourceBuilder`, `CompositeResourceActionBuilder`, `CompositeResourceReference`, `CompositeResourceConditions`, `CompositeResourceApi`, `BindableCompositeResourcePermission` and so on) and the grant policy is `{ type: 'composite', scopes }`. Resource types carry no `title`: they are never displayed, and the library holds no translation keys. A composite composes exactly the grants its definition lists, on any type except another composite. A data scope no longer names a `collection`: it targets the one resource its grant actions address (`dataScopeTarget(action, key)`), whose type must declare `recordAccess: true` on `resourceTypes.add`, as `database.collection` does; `define` checks this when the type is registered, and `authz.compositeResources.validate()` and first use check types registered later. The library holds no display concepts. `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization` provides `authz.ui`, also exposed to plugin setup contexts: `ui.sections.add` for the top-level sections `pages`, `business` and `administration` and one level of subsections (with `extend: true` for a subsection another plugin owns, as workflow owns `automation` and scheduler extends it), `ui.groups.add` for right-side groups, `ui.place(ref, { section, group? })`, and `ui.defaultSection(type, section)`. `pagesPlugin` registers the `pages.page` subsection, the only one the client fills, from its route tree. The client no longer remaps the `@nocobase/authorization` namespace. `authz.settings.add` no longer takes `section`; settings items and composites are placed with `authz.ui.place`, and unplaced ones land in their type's default section "Other". Startup validation runs after every provider has booted and reports unknown subsections and groups, placements of unregistered resources and unfit data scopes, throwing in development and logging a warning in production. A resource holds at most one default-access rule: the table is unique on `(resourceType, resourceId)` as well as `key`, and a second rule raises `DefaultAccessConflictError`, answered with 409. `authorizationToken` is the only service token: `permissionSetsToken` is gone, `authz.db` is now `authz.database`, settings items are registered with `authz.settings.add` and checked with semantic actions, and rule plugins build on `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization/server/extension`. The client exposes `AuthorizationClient.snapshot/revision/invalidate/onInvalidated` and renamed management components. Every client page route must now declare `authz` (a check or `'skip'`); nothing is inferred from the route name. The authorization migrations and seeds were edited in place, including the new `key` column on default-access rules, so existing databases must be reset and reinstalled. A stored composite grant that no longer expands — an unknown action or data scope, an invalid scope value or policy — is skipped for that grant alone instead of failing every check of the identity: it permits nothing, a direct check of its action denies with `INVALID_GRANT`, and `createAuthorization({ onInvalidGrant })` is told once, which the application plugin logs; `authz.compositeResources.validateGrant` explains a stored grant, and the plugin's startup validation scans every stored Permission Set, throwing in development and warning in production. `authz.database.collections.add` treats a re-registration with the same actions as a no-op even when its title or description differ, keeping the first and reporting a startup warning through `collections.warnings()`; only different actions throw. `authz.resourceTypes.get(type).items.add(item)` remains the generic low-level item registration that `settings.add`, `database.collections.add` and `compositeResources.define` build on.

## 0.1.0-beta.5

### Patch Changes

- 709f9ed: Update Better Auth and API keys to 1.7.5 and align fresh authentication databases with provider-based account identity. Existing authentication databases must be recreated; the original account migration has changed and no compatibility migration is provided.
- fa01814: Add `db apply` and `db reset`, and retire `migrate --fresh`.

  `nocobase app db apply` (`pnpm db:apply`) runs migrations and seeds as one plan, in the order startup runs them: each connection is migrated, then seeded. Only pending tasks run, so repeating it is safe. `nocobase app db reset` (`pnpm db:reset`) drops every managed schema object first and reruns both from empty; it asks for confirmation and requires `--force` in CI or a non-interactive terminal.

  `migrate --fresh` is removed and now exits with a pointer to `db reset`. It rebuilt the schema without reseeding, so it left the seed history cleared and no seed executed — the default connection recovered on the next startup, and a connection with `autoRun: false` did not.

  The `migrate` and `seed` commands are removed along with their template scripts; `db apply` replaces both. Running one half on its own is not a separate command, because both halves apply only what is pending: on an already-migrated database `db apply` applies seeds alone, and the one case it does not cover — migrating ahead of a deployment without seeding — can be served by a flag later without breaking anything.

  `runAppDatabaseTasks` accepts several task kinds in one plan through its `kind` option, which is what makes a reset correct across both kinds: one plan means a connection's schema is rebuilt by its migrations task before its seeds run.

- d696700: Give every settings surface the token that matches what it is, so panels stop disagreeing with one another.

  The permission set editor is where this shows: its two tabs sit in one panel, and the permission configuration tab painted itself `bg-background` while the assignment tab inherited the panel's `bg-card`, so switching tabs changed the page colour under the same heading. The same mistake is spread across the settings pages, and none of it is visible under a preset whose page and card are near-identical.

  Each token names a layer rather than a shade, and every site now uses the one that describes it. A panel resting on the page is `bg-card`, which is what the AI tools and skills pages already used while the LLM service, MCP service, conversation, API key, user and notification log panels named the page surface instead — two lists in one plugin, one framed and one flat. A dialog or drawer is `bg-popover`, which is what the shared `Sheet`, `Dialog` and `Popover` primitives use and what six hand-rolled drawers and dialogs did not. An opaque sticky header, footer or table head names the surface it scrolls within rather than the page behind it. A form control names no surface at all and inherits the one it sits on, the way the shared `Input` and `Textarea` do with `bg-transparent`; twenty hand-rolled inputs, selects and text areas were pinned to the page colour and showed through as a differently coloured box inside every card.

  The styling reference now states which token describes which layer, and why picking one because it happens to look right is what puts a page-coloured block inside a panel.

## 0.1.0-beta.4

### Patch Changes

- 64b3fdb: Remove Refine from client authorization checks. Use `AuthorizationClient.can({ resource, action })` instead of the removed two-argument signature, and import `useCan` from `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization/client`. Migrate page guards, navigation, and notification visibility while preserving session isolation and realtime permission invalidation.

  Remove the Refine access-control configuration and legacy global authorization client accessors. Resolve the application-owned client through `useAuthorizationClient()` or `authorizationClientToken`. Settings actions now revoke stale access immediately; route checks no longer bypass the authorization page or translate Refine CRUD action names.

  Unify route authorization under `authz: 'skip' | { resource: { type, id }, action }`. Normalize default rules during registration and share them across page guards, navigation, permission discovery, and inspection. Remove the legacy `access` field and string resource adapter.

  Limit settings action checks to the actions each page uses, keep the permission-set action helper internal, and avoid rebuilding navigation twice when selecting a route.

### Patch Changes

- 365a9fe: Complete English and Chinese translations for authentication, route feedback, authorization, shared controls, File and Notification Registry components, and development examples. Use concise semantic keys consistently for the new translations. Resolve AI Registry copy from the active language and localize development navigation and section headings. Translate MCP configuration guidance, tool drawer labels, and transport descriptions.
- 60fa139: Add confirmed user deletion for Hub platform administrators. Protect the current user, the last active platform administrator, and users who own applications. Revoke sessions and API Keys transactionally while retaining an inactive identity record for historical attribution. Prevent new applications and publishing keys from being created for deleted owners.
- 60fa139: Reuse the API Keys plugin through configuration-bound server operations and a scoped Authentication plugin API that preserves hooks and caller-owned transactions. Add per-application publishing API key management in Hub with one-time secret display, scoped Release and Deployment access, expiration, revocation, and current-owner permission checks.
- 60fa139: Add streamed, checksum-verified Hub release uploads, persistent upload and deployment retry identities, explicit upload-and-deploy requests, and App CLI upload/deploy commands. Reuse existing upload-release and deploy authorization actions and expose minimal deployment status for CI. Preserve historical releases during canonical checksum migration. Normalize permissions returned by the generic API key service.

  Support optional runtime configuration files for deploy and upload-with-deploy, with bounded streaming transport, existing configuration reuse, and configuration-aware retry checks.

  Reject upload-and-deploy requests that cannot return a publishing deployment, including CLI calls without waiting. Correct the unmerged publishing migration rollback.

- 60fa139: Declare the Better Auth API Key plugin's runtime peers explicitly so deployments with automatic peer installation disabled can load the plugin even when Better Auth's own dependencies are nested.

  Use plugin-owned PageHeader components for consistent titles, descriptions, and page actions while preserving permission checks and workflow detail navigation.

  Preserve spacing below workflow tabs and wrap workflow list filters and actions on narrow screens.

  Restore spacing between workflow detail back links and headings, and keep execution duration cells aligned when table rows grow.

## 0.1.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- 154e09e: Add `@nocobase/app-plugin-api-keys`, which lets scripts and integrations call an application's API as the user who issued the key.

  The package is Better Auth's API Key plugin plus the parts an application needs around it: the `apikey` table migration, a self-service Settings page where each user creates and revokes their own keys, and `apiKey` and `apiKeyClient` carrying Better Auth's own names and options. `apiKey` is wrapped only to supply three defaults, all of them overridable; its documentation applies unchanged.

  The re-export is what keeps the migration honest. That table has to match the schema the installed `@better-auth/api-key` declares, so both come from one package rather than from a dependency each application pins separately; a test asserts the table carries a column for every field the plugin declares.

  Configured in `auth.plugins`, `Auth.getSession()` resolves an `x-api-key` header the same way it resolves a session cookie, so `auth.required()`, the route guards, and Authorization all see the owning user and exactly the roles that user holds. No application route needs to know a request arrived by key.

  The three defaults are `enableSessionForAPIKeys: true`, `rateLimit: { enabled: false }` and `requireName: true`. The first is the one that has to be set: Better Auth defaults it off, and with it off a key authenticates nothing — the page still issues keys and every request carrying one answers 401, with nothing pointing at the configuration. The second avoids the upstream default of 10 requests per key per day, which is a quota for issuing keys rather than for using them. Supplying them here rather than in each application's auth config is what keeps a required setting from being something an application can silently get wrong.

  A key is its owner, so it also reaches the Better Auth endpoints a session reaches — including `/api-key/create`, which means a key can mint a successor with its own expiry that revoking the first key does not revoke. Revoking a leaked key means reviewing the owner's whole list. An application that wants that closed adds its own `before` hook.
