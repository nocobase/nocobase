# @nocobase/app-plugin-notification

## 1.0.0-beta.22

### Patch Changes

- e123790: Move `@nocobase/app-server`, `@nocobase/app-client`, `@nocobase/app-plugin-authentication`, `@nocobase/app-plugin-users`, `@nocobase/app-plugin-hub`, `@nocobase/app-plugin-workflow` and `@nocobase/app-plugin-ai-employee` to the 2.0.0 prerelease line. The HTTP API migration released in 1.0.0-beta.N changed every route and the error body, but in prerelease mode a `major` changeset on a version that is already a `1.0.0` prerelease only increments the prerelease number, so nothing in the version said the change was breaking. These packages now release as `2.0.0-beta.0`, and every package that depends on or peers with one of them is released again so that its published range is `^2.0.0-beta.0` rather than a `^1.0.0-beta` range the new versions do not satisfy. An application upgrading to these versions upgrades all of them together.

## 1.0.0-beta.21

### Major Changes

- 21d274c: Workflow, scheduler, i18n and notification routes follow the HTTP API specification: every success is `{ data }` (lists `{ data, meta }`), every failure is the standard error body, and every input is validated, with unknown JSON body fields rejected as 400 `INVALID_INPUT`.

  **Workflow** (domain `workflows`). Runs move under the workflow namespace: `/api/workflow-runs` -> `/api/workflows/runs`, `/api/workflow-runs/{id}` -> `/api/workflows/runs/{runId}`, `/api/workflow-runs/{id}/node-runs[/{nodeRunId}/payload]` -> `/api/workflows/runs/{runId}/nodeRuns[/{nodeRunId}/payload]`. Source previews move from `/api/workflows/by-key/{key}/source[/revisions]` to `/api/workflows/sources/{key}[/revisions]`. `PATCH /api/workflows/{id}/status` is removed (use `POST .../enable` and `.../disable`), and `GET /api/workflows/{id}/runs` is removed (use `GET /api/workflows/runs?workflowId=`). Revision and node-run lists answer `{ data, meta: { page, pageSize, total } }`. `POST /api/workflows/{id}/run` requires `{ input }` and validates the `Event-Key` header; `PUT /api/workflows/{id}/parameters` requires `{ parameterValues }`. A workflow, source, run or node run named by the path that does not exist is 404 (was 400); permission denial is 403 `WORKFLOW_MANAGEMENT_REQUIRED`; an unconfigured service is 503 `WORKFLOW_SERVICE_NOT_CONFIGURED`. Invocation codes are kept as reasons: `WORKFLOW_NOT_FOUND` is 404, `WORKFLOW_DISABLED`, `PARENT_RUN_NOT_FOUND` and `STACK_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` are `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `INVALID_INPUT` is `INVALID_ARGUMENT` with field violations, and `INPUT_TOO_LARGE` answers 413. Translated text is in `localizedMessage`.

  **Scheduler** (domain `scheduler`). `/api/schedules` -> `/api/scheduler/schedules`, paged by `page` and `pageSize` with `meta: { page, pageSize, total }`. New `GET /api/scheduler/schedules/{scheduleId}`. `GET /api/scheduler/schedules/{scheduleId}/occurrences` is cursor-paged by `pageSize` and `pageToken` with `meta: { nextPageToken }`, replacing the fixed latest-100 list. `POST .../enable` and `.../disable` keep their shape under the new prefix. A caller without access gets 403 `SCHEDULE_ACCESS_REQUIRED` (was `{ error: 'Schedule access is required.' }`), and an unknown schedule id gets 404 `SCHEDULE_NOT_FOUND` (was 500, or an empty occurrence list).

  **i18n** (domain `i18n`). `GET /api/i18n/locales` answers `{ data: { defaultLocale, locales } }`. `POST /api/i18n/locale` -> `PUT /api/i18n/locale`, answering `{ data: { locale, requestedLocale, fallback } }`; an unsupported language still falls back to English successfully. A missing or invalid `locale` is 400 `INVALID_INPUT` with a field violation (was `{ error: 'A locale is required.' }`), in the standard error body even when the router is mounted on its own.

  **Notification** (domain `notifications`). `GET /api/notifications/logs` is cursor-paged (`pageSize`, `pageToken`) and answers `{ data, meta: { nextPageToken } }`; `/api/notifications/logs/:id` is `/api/notifications/logs/{logId}`. `GET /api/notifications/test/targets` -> `GET /api/notifications/testTargets`, `POST /api/notifications/test/send` -> `POST /api/notifications/testSends` (strict `{ channel, values }`, 202), `GET /api/notifications/test/{id}/status` -> `GET /api/notifications/testSends/{testSendId}`. The `{ error: { code, message, ns, key, params } }` body is gone: `reason` carries the former code, `localizedMessage` the translated text and `metadata` its parameters; invalid test fields report `fieldViolations`, and `NOTIFICATION_TEST_FAILED` is 503 `UNAVAILABLE` only when the Channel's transport cannot be reached (the new exported `NotificationTransportUnavailableError`); any other failure of a test send is no longer reported as `NOTIFICATION_TEST_FAILED`. `GET /api/notifications/testTargets` answers `{ data, meta: { total } }`. `NotificationTestApiError` exposes `reason` instead of `code`, `ns`, `key` and `params`, and `NotificationStore.listLogs()` accepts an optional cursor.

  **In-app notification** (domain `notificationInApp`). The inbox moves from `/api/notifications/in-app` to `/api/notificationInApp`: `GET /messages` (`pageSize`, `pageToken`, `unreadOnly` -> `{ data, meta: { nextPageToken } }`, replacing `limit`, `cursor` and `nextCursor`), `GET /messages/unreadCount` -> `{ data: { count } }`, `POST /messages/markAllRead` (was `/read-all`), `POST /messages/{messageId}/markRead` and `/markUnread` and `DELETE /messages/{messageId}` (204), replacing `POST /:id { action }`. Every inbox route runs behind the authentication plugin's `auth.required()` and reads the user only from the Better Auth session: it no longer falls back to, or writes, a `userId` in the NocoBase session, so an inbox request after sign-out or without a session is 401 `UNAUTHENTICATED` with reason `AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED` in the `authentication` domain. `createInAppRouter(store, options)` requires `options.authenticate`, a middleware that sets `auth`, and `resolveUserId` and `InAppUserIdResolver` are removed. An anonymous request reaching `createInAppRouter` without `auth` is 401 `UNAUTHENTICATED` with reason `IN_APP_NOTIFICATION_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED`, `IN_APP_NOTIFICATION_INVALID_CURSOR` is now `IN_APP_NOTIFICATION_INVALID_PAGE_TOKEN`, and the limit, body and action errors are gone. The client helpers take `pageSize` and `pageToken`, return `nextPageToken`, and `mutateInboxItem` deletes with `DELETE`.

  The application templates' tests follow the new locale and inbox response shapes.

### Patch Changes

- be0fbbd: The notification migration-runner test and the workflow integration tests run on the database `NOCOBASE_TEST_DB_DIALECT` selects through `@nocobase/db-testing`, instead of each reading a variable of its own (`NOTIFICATION_MIGRATION_DIALECT`, `INTEGRATION_DB_CONNECTIONS`) and configuring the server by hand; the notification test previously ran only when that variable was set, which no script did. Workflow's `test:integration:postgres` and `test:integration:mysql` set the new variable. Both packages replace their `@nocobase/db-mysql`, `@nocobase/db-oracle` and `@nocobase/db-postgres` development dependencies with `@nocobase/db-testing`; nothing either package ships changes.
- 0b933b3: Declare every hand-written `/api` route of the file, notification, in-app notification, scheduler and Database Explorer plugins in the application's API document at `/api/swagger/docs`, with response schemas and the error statuses each route answers. The file plugin documents the `uploadOne` and `uploadMany` endpoints of each exposure as `multipart/form-data` beside that exposure's data endpoints, under its tag and with operationIds such as `attachmentsUploadOne`. Each file exposure declares the `contentUrl` it adds to every record as a computed field, so the record schema of its data endpoints lists it, read-only, beside the Collection's fields. Route input is now validated through `apiValidator()`, which answers invalid input exactly as before. A route lists `403` only where it checks a permission, so the in-app inbox routes list `401` and `500`; the `400` for invalid input comes from the input validators, and a route that can answer `400` for another reason, such as an invalid page token or cursor or an unavailable test target, declares it with its reasons.
- be0fbbd: Tests in these plugins and example plugins take their fixtures from `@nocobase/app-testing` alone: database fixtures such as `createDatabaseTest()`, `describeMigration()` and `expectCollection()` from `@nocobase/app-testing/server`, and the command runner from `@nocobase/app-testing/cli`. Each package replaces its `@nocobase/db-testing` development dependency with `@nocobase/app-testing`. Nothing any of them ships changes.
- be0fbbd: Database tests in these plugins and example plugins take their database from `@nocobase/db-testing` instead of configuring an in-memory SQLite database, so they run on SQLite by default and on the database `NOCOBASE_TEST_DB_DIALECT` selects otherwise. Schema assertions that read `PRAGMA` output or `sqlite_master` are written with `expectCollection()` against Field and Collection names, migration up and down tests use `describeMigration()`, and the SQLite triggers that made a write fail are replaced by spies on the write. Each package replaces its `@nocobase/db-sqlite` development dependency with `@nocobase/db-testing`; nothing any of them ships changes.

### Patch Changes

- 9291dbb: Pass `locales` the same way on the client and the server

  `defineClientPlugin`, `defineServerPlugin` and both sides' `defineAppRuntime` now accept the `locales/index.ts` module itself or a function importing it, typed as the new `LocalesContribution` from `@nocobase/i18n`, which also exports `resolveLocalesContribution` to turn either into the module. Previously the client took only the module and the server only a function, so a plugin wired the same file two different ways. The module is the recommended form on both sides: each language in it is already a separate dynamic import, so importing the map statically loads no translations early. Existing `locales: () => import('./locales/index.js')` declarations keep working unchanged. `@nocobase/app-server` exports `AppServerPluginLocales` for the widened type and keeps `AppServerPluginLocalesLoader` as a deprecated alias. The bundled plugins, the application templates' `server/runtime.ts` and plugins generated by `create-plugin` now import their server locales statically.

- e77641b: Point plugin guidance at `@nocobase/jobs` for background work, and at the rebuilt `@nocobase/queue` only for what jobs cannot do

  The Scheduler Skill now hands a target's lengthy work to a `JobExecutor` owned by the target's Provider, with the occurrence's own execution record as the reference, so a repeated start of the same occurrence returns the same reference; the job decides and reports its terminal outcome itself, because it cannot tell which executor attempt is the last. Recurring work without administrator visibility goes to a `ScheduleExecutor`, and only a one-time delay goes to a queue. Its description of Scheduler's own backend now names the jobs service and `scheduler.jobs` instead of the removed `queue.queues.schedule` connection. The Notification Skill's diagnostics check the jobs configuration Deliveries run on instead of a queue manager.

  The plugins' `AGENTS.md` list `@nocobase/queue` as a host-owned contract rather than a job registry. The jobs README states that background work goes there by default, the i18n Skill speaks of background jobs rather than queue jobs, and the departments example no longer composes the removed `QueueProvider` in its tests.

### Minor Changes

- 52f9811: Run Delivery tasks on `@nocobase/jobs` instead of `@nocobase/queue`

  **Breaking.** Notification now submits each Delivery to its own `JobExecutor` from `@nocobase/app-server/jobs`, on the `@nocobase/app-plugin-notification` scope, and depends on `@nocobase/jobs` as a peer instead of `@nocobase/queue`. The plugin sets the executor up when it starts, so Deliveries are consumed on every jobs backend. Before this change, nothing consumed the queue's `default` queue on a `redis` or `database` connection, and Deliveries waited there until the application ran on the `sync` driver. A Delivery in progress now finishes before its Channel's Provider is closed on shutdown.

  `notification.jobs` names the `jobs` configuration Deliveries run on. Left out, they follow `jobs.default`. A name that `jobs` does not define stops the application from starting. The memory adapter serves one process, so an application running more than one instance needs a `redis` jobs configuration.

  `createNotificationManager` takes `executor: JobExecutor` in place of `queue`, and owns its lifecycle: it registers the Delivery job and sets the executor up on activation, and shuts it down in `close()`. `NotificationRuntime.activate()` now returns a promise.

  Upgrading: compose `JobExecutorServiceProvider` in `server/app.ts` and declare `@nocobase/jobs` as a dependency. The application templates already do both. Deliveries still waiting in a queue connection are not moved. The reconciler resubmits every pending Delivery from the database, so none is lost.

## 0.1.0-beta.17

### Patch Changes

- c8ddd7d: Consolidate the authorization API. Resource types are either catalog types (`settings`, `composite`, `database.collection`), whose items and actions must be registered, or record types (`page`, `user`, `notification`, `hub.app`, `hub.host`), which declare type-level actions and judge each record; there are no `*` items. Business resources become composite resources, a built-in core mechanism: every Authorization has `authz.compositeResources` (which replaces `authz.business`) and reserves the `composite` resource type, so `businessPlugin()` is gone with no replacement and `resourceTypes.add({ type: 'composite' })` throws; `defineBusinessResource` is `defineCompositeResource`, every `Business*` type is `CompositeResource*` (`CompositeResource`, `CompositeResourceBuilder`, `CompositeResourceActionBuilder`, `CompositeResourceReference`, `CompositeResourceConditions`, `CompositeResourceApi`, `BindableCompositeResourcePermission` and so on) and the grant policy is `{ type: 'composite', scopes }`. Resource types carry no `title`: they are never displayed, and the library holds no translation keys. A composite composes exactly the grants its definition lists, on any type except another composite. A data scope no longer names a `collection`: it targets the one resource its grant actions address (`dataScopeTarget(action, key)`), whose type must declare `recordAccess: true` on `resourceTypes.add`, as `database.collection` does; `define` checks this when the type is registered, and `authz.compositeResources.validate()` and first use check types registered later. The library holds no display concepts. `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization` provides `authz.ui`, also exposed to plugin setup contexts: `ui.sections.add` for the top-level sections `pages`, `business` and `administration` and one level of subsections (with `extend: true` for a subsection another plugin owns, as workflow owns `automation` and scheduler extends it), `ui.groups.add` for right-side groups, `ui.place(ref, { section, group? })`, and `ui.defaultSection(type, section)`. `pagesPlugin` registers the `pages.page` subsection, the only one the client fills, from its route tree. The client no longer remaps the `@nocobase/authorization` namespace. `authz.settings.add` no longer takes `section`; settings items and composites are placed with `authz.ui.place`, and unplaced ones land in their type's default section "Other". Startup validation runs after every provider has booted and reports unknown subsections and groups, placements of unregistered resources and unfit data scopes, throwing in development and logging a warning in production. A resource holds at most one default-access rule: the table is unique on `(resourceType, resourceId)` as well as `key`, and a second rule raises `DefaultAccessConflictError`, answered with 409. `authorizationToken` is the only service token: `permissionSetsToken` is gone, `authz.db` is now `authz.database`, settings items are registered with `authz.settings.add` and checked with semantic actions, and rule plugins build on `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization/server/extension`. The client exposes `AuthorizationClient.snapshot/revision/invalidate/onInvalidated` and renamed management components. Every client page route must now declare `authz` (a check or `'skip'`); nothing is inferred from the route name. The authorization migrations and seeds were edited in place, including the new `key` column on default-access rules, so existing databases must be reset and reinstalled. A stored composite grant that no longer expands — an unknown action or data scope, an invalid scope value or policy — is skipped for that grant alone instead of failing every check of the identity: it permits nothing, a direct check of its action denies with `INVALID_GRANT`, and `createAuthorization({ onInvalidGrant })` is told once, which the application plugin logs; `authz.compositeResources.validateGrant` explains a stored grant, and the plugin's startup validation scans every stored Permission Set, throwing in development and warning in production. `authz.database.collections.add` treats a re-registration with the same actions as a no-op even when its title or description differ, keeping the first and reporting a startup warning through `collections.warnings()`; only different actions throw. `authz.resourceTypes.get(type).items.add(item)` remains the generic low-level item registration that `settings.add`, `database.collections.add` and `compositeResources.define` build on.

### Minor Changes

- ffafc2a: Use unique Channel map keys for sending, test sending, runtime isolation and retries. Preserve message types separately in delivery records and reject retries after the original Channel or Provider becomes unavailable. Migrate existing Channel identities and update application configuration and integration guidance.
- ffafc2a: Replace actionUrl with a validated route-or-URL target. Render internal inbox routes through the application Router and full URLs through native links. Add nullable target storage without converting historical links, expose test-send target fields, and include only URL targets in IM messages. Legacy actionUrl values are ignored.
- ffafc2a: Replace notification configuration with named single-Provider Channels and send complete messages through a Channel-keyed map. Validate all messages before enqueueing, deliver native recipients independently, and retain retries bound to the original Channel and Provider. Simplify the test form and remove Provider instance names from delivery records with a new migration.

### Patch Changes

- ffafc2a: Move notification documentation to the root documentation site, keep plugin packages focused on their published Skills, and simplify Delivery retry status and configuration.
- ffafc2a: Translate missing in-app notification recipient errors in notification logs and add a stable provider error code.

### Patch Changes

- d696700: Give every settings surface the token that matches what it is, so panels stop disagreeing with one another.

  The permission set editor is where this shows: its two tabs sit in one panel, and the permission configuration tab painted itself `bg-background` while the assignment tab inherited the panel's `bg-card`, so switching tabs changed the page colour under the same heading. The same mistake is spread across the settings pages, and none of it is visible under a preset whose page and card are near-identical.

  Each token names a layer rather than a shade, and every site now uses the one that describes it. A panel resting on the page is `bg-card`, which is what the AI tools and skills pages already used while the LLM service, MCP service, conversation, API key, user and notification log panels named the page surface instead — two lists in one plugin, one framed and one flat. A dialog or drawer is `bg-popover`, which is what the shared `Sheet`, `Dialog` and `Popover` primitives use and what six hand-rolled drawers and dialogs did not. An opaque sticky header, footer or table head names the surface it scrolls within rather than the page behind it. A form control names no surface at all and inherits the one it sits on, the way the shared `Input` and `Textarea` do with `bg-transparent`; twenty hand-rolled inputs, selects and text areas were pinned to the page colour and showed through as a differently coloured box inside every card.

  The styling reference now states which token describes which layer, and why picking one because it happens to look right is what puts a page-coloured block inside a panel.

### Patch Changes

- 64b3fdb: Separate authorization services from application integration: the library provides decisions, permission-set and access-rule services, store contracts and handlers; the application plugin owns database adapters, migrations, identities and management UI.

  Add configurable root and default permission sets, protected-set metadata, transaction-bound service APIs, and integration with user management and Hub roles. Add database authorization for explicitly registered collections through Repository policies, plus a runnable example plugin.

  Provide a permission-set workspace with routed editing and user assignments, nested resource groups, field and record-scope controls, and a permission inspector. Localize management UI and request-specific resource labels. Application routes may declare signed-in access without a page grant.

  Migration ownership changes inline the existing table definitions in the application plugin. This changes the checksums of previously executed migrations; upgrade compatibility must be resolved before deploying to an existing database.

- 64b3fdb: Separate business resource declarations from underlying handler registration through `resourceTypes`. Remove transitional registration aliases and legacy title decoding. Store rule record IDs directly in each action's JSON, preserving independent named scopes without auxiliary record tables. Initialize the sales example and Hub permission titles directly in their final form, without development-version upgrade scripts.
- 64b3fdb: Remove Refine from client authorization checks. Use `AuthorizationClient.can({ resource, action })` instead of the removed two-argument signature, and import `useCan` from `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization/client`. Migrate page guards, navigation, and notification visibility while preserving session isolation and realtime permission invalidation.

  Remove the Refine access-control configuration and legacy global authorization client accessors. Resolve the application-owned client through `useAuthorizationClient()` or `authorizationClientToken`. Settings actions now revoke stale access immediately; route checks no longer bypass the authorization page or translate Refine CRUD action names.

  Unify route authorization under `authz: 'skip' | { resource: { type, id }, action }`. Normalize default rules during registration and share them across page guards, navigation, permission discovery, and inspection. Remove the legacy `access` field and string resource adapter.

  Limit settings action checks to the actions each page uses, keep the permission-set action helper internal, and avoid rebuilding navigation twice when selecting a route.

### Patch Changes

- e13ed84: Persist per-deployment phase and failure logs and expose application runtime logs in Hub with scoped access, incremental reading, retention, and independent file and console outputs.

  Unify runtime logging configuration and source routing, merge default outputs into app files, connect workflow diagnostics with execution identities, and preserve legacy configuration and historical log readability.

  Enforce hosted capture policy, declare the Host server runtime peer, merge paged source logs chronologically with bounded opaque cursors, and preserve correlation and error details when truncating oversized records. Handle expired scans explicitly in the Hub viewer and downloads.

  Route HTTP request logs to separate request files by default in all application templates.

Use concise semantic keys consistently for the new translations. Resolve AI Registry copy from the active language and localize development navigation and section headings. Translate MCP configuration guidance, tool drawer labels, and transport descriptions.
- d4ca00e: Use the application's API client for Hub artifact uploads and the notification logs Registry page so requests honor the configured API base URL. Pass the client explicitly to uploadArtifact and fetchNotificationLogs while retaining upload bodies, log responses and cancellation.

  Use plugin-owned PageHeader components for consistent titles, descriptions, and page actions while preserving permission checks and workflow detail navigation.

  Preserve spacing below workflow tabs and wrap workflow list filters and actions on narrow screens.

  Restore spacing between workflow detail back links and headings, and keep execution duration cells aligned when table rows grow.

## 0.1.0-beta.9

### Patch Changes

- 63db898: Move concrete database connection types into their owning dialect packages and keep the core connection contract independent of installed dialects. Import `SqliteConnectionConfig`, `PostgresConnectionConfig`, `MysqlConnectionConfig`, `OracleConnectionConfig`, and `MssqlConnectionConfig` from the corresponding `@nocobase/db-<dialect>` package instead of `@nocobase/db`.

  `ConnectionConfig` and the default `DatabaseConfig` and `AppDatabaseConfig` now describe the common runtime contract. For strict configuration checking, supply a concrete connection type or use `DatabaseConfigFromDrivers` and `AppDatabaseConfigFromDrivers`. The core also exports `DriverConnectionConfig` and `ConnectionConfigFromDrivers` for reusable driver inference. Preserve mutually exclusive host and socket targets in MySQL and OceanBase configuration and factory options.

- a60decd: Require an explicit absolute baseDir for Server plugins and resolve migrations, seeds, jobs, and package metadata from the loaded plugin copy. Generate and validate database task manifests during builds so TypeScript and JavaScript share source checksums, with verified legacy JavaScript history conversion and synchronized plugin scaffolding and application templates.
- 1a85a86: Add breadcrumb labels to plugin routes so nested pages show their navigation path.

### Minor Changes

- f17f3a6: Provide editable TypeScript defaults for application modules, assembled by the runtime before services start. Module factories receive the runtime with application paths and plugin metadata; deployment files and environment variables override defaults, and configuration reload preserves code defaults.

  Keep deployment settings in YAML examples and reserve explicit environment overrides for secrets and startup integration. Simplify application configuration loading, merging and reload subscriptions.

  Align client configuration assembly with the server: runtime merges application TypeScript defaults beneath public configuration before services start. Client inspection reports the application configuration entry.

## 0.1.0-beta.5

### Patch Changes

- 52d1107: Resolve the shared UI packages through the workspace catalog: `@base-ui/react`, `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `lucide-react`, `shadcn`, `tailwind-merge`, and `tw-animate-css`.

  Every package already agreed on one version for each of these — the catalog is what keeps them agreeing. A range edited in one manifest and not the others would otherwise put two copies of a UI primitive into an application's bundle, which is the kind of drift nothing reports until a component behaves differently depending on which plugin rendered it.

  Peer dependencies use `catalog:` too. `pnpm pack` resolves it before publishing, so a consumer still reads an ordinary range.

- 52d1107: Declare the packages each plugin's browser code imports as peer dependencies, so an application that installs the plugin can resolve them while a server deployment installs none of them.

  A plugin's `client/` is not bundled by the plugin: `build` is `tsc`, so `dist/client/*.js` keeps its bare imports and the consuming application's Vite build resolves them. That application has only what the published manifest declares, and npm does not publish `devDependencies` — so a client import declared only there fails with `Could not resolve "…"`. `sonner` and `@xyflow/react` both shipped that way. Ten of these plugins appeared to work only because `app-template-default` happened to declare the same package for its own use; `@nocobase/app-plugin-hub`'s CodeMirror imports had no such coincidence and were unresolvable wherever it was installed.

  Peer dependencies are what satisfy both sides. An application installs one shared copy, and a deployment — which sets `autoInstallPeers: false` — installs none, so packages a server never requires stay out of it. Each keeps a matching devDependency so the workspace still resolves it and the version used here stays pinned. None is marked `optional`: an optional peer is not auto-installed anywhere, including in the application that needs it.

  `create-plugin` emits the same shape and its generated `AGENTS.md` teaches it, so a plugin created tomorrow declares its browser packages as peers rather than repeating the mistake.

- 52d1107: Declare each peer dependency once, dropping the devDependency that used to accompany it.

  The pairing was required on the grounds that a peer range is wide enough for development to drift off this repository's copy. It is not: pnpm installs a peer and links it into the plugin's own `node_modules`, resolving `workspace:^` to the same package `workspace:*` would. A plugin with the devDependency removed still links, typechecks, builds, and tests against it — verified against a clean install with every plugin's `node_modules` deleted first.

  What remained was a second declaration that changed nothing and had to be kept in step with the first. `pnpm peers:check` no longer asks for it, and `create-plugin` no longer emits it.

## Unreleased

### Minor Changes

- Move notification testing into the core plugin with safe dynamic target
  descriptors, separate `notification:test` `send` authorization, actor-scoped
  status lookup, and delivery through the normal manager send path. Validate
  enabled Channel and Provider configuration after extension registration and
  fail fast when required runtime dependencies are missing. Separate the
  public sending service from the Channel/Provider extension registry so child
  plugins do not depend on the complete manager surface.

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- 174eab5: Consolidate the browser packages into `@nocobase/app-client`.

  `@nocobase/app-sdk` is gone; its API client now lives in `@nocobase/app-client` and is imported from there. `@nocobase/app-portal-sdk` is deprecated and keeps only what still has consumers: `NocoBaseClient` and the runtime configuration it reads, which exist to reach a v2 NocoBase server, and the route surface containers under `/routing`. Its ACL, auth, data, extension, i18n, and system-settings modules are removed, as is the route tree that `/routing` used to export alongside the surfaces.

  `@nocobase/app-client` gains `resolveAppBase()`, which reports the path the application is mounted at.

  Four plugins built their API client at import time instead of resolving it from the application's service container, so they could not see `api.baseURL` from the application configuration. They now resolve it, which means an application that configures a base URL gets one client rather than two that disagree.

  The injected browser global `NOCOBASE_PORTAL_BASE` is renamed to `APP_BASE_PATH`. Its value has always been the `APP_BASE_PATH` environment variable, and the old name grouped it with the settings that address a v2 NocoBase server. Those keep their names. A client and the server that serves it must be upgraded together.

  `@nocobase/app-plugin-data-provider` is removed. It forwarded the Portal data provider, and applications built on the current client runtime do not use it.

  The Hub template is rebuilt from the default template and now runs the same client and server stack as every other v3 application. Its `/api/apps` endpoint and its v2 API proxy are gone, so a hub's `.env` no longer configures them.

  The Portal SDK's template compatibility check is removed with the rest: it had been disabled behind a constant, and its install script cost every generated project a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `allowBuilds` entry it did not need. `createPortalViteConfig` no longer takes the plugin that injected it.

- 1527426: Declare identity-sensitive runtime packages as peer dependencies of every plugin.

  A plugin used to list `@nocobase/app-server`, `@nocobase/db`, `@nocobase/service-provider`, `@nocobase/i18n`, `@nocobase/queue`, `@nocobase/app-portal-sdk`, and the plugins it builds on among its `dependencies`. Each of these carries state that only works while exactly one copy of the module exists in the process: `ServiceContainer` keys its bindings by the token object itself, React contexts match only the provider created from the same module, and `@nocobase/queue` registers job classes into a global `Locator`. A `dependencies` range lets a package manager install a second copy to satisfy it, which splits that state.

  The monorepo could never show the problem, because `workspace:` links every consumer to one directory. It appears once a plugin is installed from a registry into an application, and it appears at runtime rather than at install time: a service that is registered reports `Service "..." is not registered`, or a context reads `undefined` under a mounted provider.

  Each of these packages is now a peer dependency paired with a devDependency. The peer is the published contract that makes the installing application provide the single copy; the devDependency pins this repository's copy for development and tests, which the deliberately wide peer range does not. Applications built from the templates are unaffected — they already install every one of these packages directly, which is what satisfies the new peer ranges.

  `pnpm plugin:create` generates the same shape, and `pnpm peers:check` enforces it in CI.

### Patch Changes

- c64802c: Publish an application-facing Agent Skill for integrating, configuring, sending, inspecting, extending, and diagnosing NocoBase notifications.
- 174eab5: Correct the `@nocobase/app-portal-sdk` range these Registry recipes declare. It named `^2.0.0`, a version the v3 package never had, so installing one of these recipes into an application could not resolve the dependency it needs for its v2 API calls.
- c64802c: Harden notification packaging, Provider error redaction, in-app pagination and input validation, migration coverage, Agent Skill safety, localization, and production demo-route defaults.

### Minor Changes

- ac3f033: Replace aggregated application configuration objects and config factories with typed module-owned configuration definitions. Applications now compose defaults, file providers, environment layers, validation, explicit reloads, and subscriptions through `AppConfig`, while providers read their configuration through `app.config.get(definition)`.

### Patch Changes

- 78cf0a2: Generate runtime-aware TypeScript, ESLint, Node engine, and development dependency configuration for Client-only, Server-only, and full-stack plugins, including stable package-scoped Queue Job identities.

  Keep plugins aligned with the Agent development contract by giving Queue, System Information, and Workflow Routes path-scoped authentication, documenting the Queue API path and Database declaration source accurately, and storing example tests under each plugin's root test directory.

- fb1a752: Unify Client and Server application composition around the explicit `serviceProviders` contribution and rename Client React tree contributions to `reactProviders`.

  Replace Client bootstrap modules with application-owned ServiceProvider lifecycle hooks, make the default Client start through `ClientApplication` and render through the Browser host, and update built-in plugins and runtime inspection to the new static contribution protocol.

## 0.0.2-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- 7cdffbd: Replace separate API and root route arrays with one ordered `routes` contribution array. Route factories now receive the Application, create and return their own Hono router, and are mounted automatically at `/api` or the application root according to their definition.

  Standardize plugin server modules around `providers/index.ts` and `routes/index.ts` collection entries, `services/` domain implementations, and a stable `tokens.ts` public contract.

  Generated plugins now declare conventional database and queue contribution directories by default. Missing optional directories are ignored until executable migrations, seeds, or jobs are added.

  Generated plugins now include an App-facing starter Agent Skill under the package's `skills/` directory. Plugin registration and skill synchronization copy these package-owned Skills into registered applications' `.agents/skills/` directories.

  Unify Client page contributions behind one `routes` loader. Plugins now use `defineAppRoutes()` and `defineSettingsRoutes()` to add child Routes to the application's two built-in Client Routes, mirroring how Server plugins use `defineRootRoutes()` and `defineApiRoutes()` with the built-in Hono routers.

- 7cdffbd: Add explicit `server/plugin.ts` definitions for Providers, API routes, root routes, database sources, and queue jobs. Register routes in a dedicated Application phase after Provider boot, add reusable HTTP and runtime composition helpers to their owning packages, and remove the default template's duplicate runtime layer and legacy plugin discovery contract.
- 8438765: Add Resend, Feishu, and DingTalk notification Providers; allow Feishu and DingTalk to be enabled together with logical IM targets and channel-scoped `single` or `all` Provider routing; add provider-aware recipient resolution and structured delivery errors; add an access-controlled Notification logs page to Hub settings; and document secure template configuration and authenticated Provider verification.
