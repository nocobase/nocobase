# @nocobase/app-plugin-authz-restriction-rules

## 0.1.0-beta.4

### Patch Changes

- 2f97f00: The authorization Skills are self-contained: they no longer send readers to the example plugins or rely on their sample ids, and use a neutral `org.team` subject type in their snippets. Organisation work, such as departments, positions and department heads, is routed to the application development Skill's organisation reference, and each rule plugin's Skill links its permission design guide for department baselines, cross-department sharing and department-assigned restrictions, noting that the guide's core needs permission sets alone.

## 0.1.0-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- 1b139b6: List Permission Sets first and the Permission Inspector last in the authorization settings subsection, with the rule plugins between them. `authz.ui.place` accepts an optional `order` within a subsection; unordered resources follow in registration order. The permission workspace now shows a resource's key under its name, and its sidebar leads with subsections, keeping section headers as muted labels.
- ec92b20: Plugin commands are `AppCommand`s and print the command envelope under `--json`. `scheduler sync` creates the application through `withApp()`, so it acts on the application the runner located rather than the current directory and always destroys the runtime. `workflow build` path flags are `appPath()` flags, so their defaults resolve against the application root from any directory. The CLI example's `artifact build` is a development command, and `pnpm plugin:create --with cli` generates an `AppCommand` with a test that uses `@nocobase/app-cli/testing`.

  The application Skill gains a reference on adding an application command, and the application templates and plugin `AGENTS.md` files describe commands in those terms: a command returns its result, throws `CommandError`, and creates the application with `withApp()` when it needs it. The templates import the CLI authoring API from `@nocobase/app-cli`.

- dbf5631: Replace guidance that named removed commands and layouts. The Hub's development page names the archive `nocobase build --tar` actually writes, `storage/exports/dist.tar.gz`. The scheduler Skill synchronizes with `pnpm nocobase scheduler sync` instead of `nb3 schedule:sync` and gives the deployed form, `node dist/cli/index.js scheduler sync --finalize`. The repository example applies its migrations and seeds with `nocobase db apply`, the CLI example's Skill matches its manifest and the stdout-only `--json` contract, and the i18n Skill no longer presents `pnpm i18n:check` as the monorepo form of `locales check`. Plugin `AGENTS.md` files carry the current dependency rules from the plugin template.

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- c8ddd7d: Consolidate the authorization API. Resource types are either catalog types (`settings`, `composite`, `database.collection`), whose items and actions must be registered, or record types (`page`, `user`, `notification`, `hub.app`, `hub.host`), which declare type-level actions and judge each record; there are no `*` items. Business resources become composite resources, a built-in core mechanism: every Authorization has `authz.compositeResources` (which replaces `authz.business`) and reserves the `composite` resource type, so `businessPlugin()` is gone with no replacement and `resourceTypes.add({ type: 'composite' })` throws; `defineBusinessResource` is `defineCompositeResource`, every `Business*` type is `CompositeResource*` (`CompositeResource`, `CompositeResourceBuilder`, `CompositeResourceActionBuilder`, `CompositeResourceReference`, `CompositeResourceConditions`, `CompositeResourceApi`, `BindableCompositeResourcePermission` and so on) and the grant policy is `{ type: 'composite', scopes }`. Resource types carry no `title`: they are never displayed, and the library holds no translation keys. A composite composes exactly the grants its definition lists, on any type except another composite. A data scope no longer names a `collection`: it targets the one resource its grant actions address (`dataScopeTarget(action, key)`), whose type must declare `recordAccess: true` on `resourceTypes.add`, as `database.collection` does; `define` checks this when the type is registered, and `authz.compositeResources.validate()` and first use check types registered later. The library holds no display concepts. `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization` provides `authz.ui`, also exposed to plugin setup contexts: `ui.sections.add` for the top-level sections `pages`, `business` and `administration` and one level of subsections (with `extend: true` for a subsection another plugin owns, as workflow owns `automation` and scheduler extends it), `ui.groups.add` for right-side groups, `ui.place(ref, { section, group? })`, and `ui.defaultSection(type, section)`. `pagesPlugin` registers the `pages.page` subsection, the only one the client fills, from its route tree. The client no longer remaps the `@nocobase/authorization` namespace. `authz.settings.add` no longer takes `section`; settings items and composites are placed with `authz.ui.place`, and unplaced ones land in their type's default section "Other". Startup validation runs after every provider has booted and reports unknown subsections and groups, placements of unregistered resources and unfit data scopes, throwing in development and logging a warning in production. A resource holds at most one default-access rule: the table is unique on `(resourceType, resourceId)` as well as `key`, and a second rule raises `DefaultAccessConflictError`, answered with 409. `authorizationToken` is the only service token: `permissionSetsToken` is gone, `authz.db` is now `authz.database`, settings items are registered with `authz.settings.add` and checked with semantic actions, and rule plugins build on `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization/server/extension`. The client exposes `AuthorizationClient.snapshot/revision/invalidate/onInvalidated` and renamed management components. Every client page route must now declare `authz` (a check or `'skip'`); nothing is inferred from the route name. The authorization migrations and seeds were edited in place, including the new `key` column on default-access rules, so existing databases must be reset and reinstalled. A stored composite grant that no longer expands — an unknown action or data scope, an invalid scope value or policy — is skipped for that grant alone instead of failing every check of the identity: it permits nothing, a direct check of its action denies with `INVALID_GRANT`, and `createAuthorization({ onInvalidGrant })` is told once, which the application plugin logs; `authz.compositeResources.validateGrant` explains a stored grant, and the plugin's startup validation scans every stored Permission Set, throwing in development and warning in production. `authz.database.collections.add` treats a re-registration with the same actions as a no-op even when its title or description differ, keeping the first and reporting a startup warning through `collections.warnings()`; only different actions throw. `authz.resourceTypes.get(type).items.add(item)` remains the generic low-level item registration that `settings.add`, `database.collections.add` and `compositeResources.define` build on.

## 0.1.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- 64b3fdb: Support entry-level parent references for settings routes contributed by different plugins. Preserve route ownership and localization while resolving nested groups independently of plugin order.

  Split default access, sharing rules and restriction rules into application plugins that own management endpoints, stores, migrations and UI. Keep pure authorization rules and Store contracts in the authorization library and move permission-set management HTTP handlers to the application plugin. Update all application templates to explicitly compose the new plugins. The migration ownership change assumes a fresh installation.

### Patch Changes

- 64b3fdb: Separate business resource declarations from underlying handler registration through `resourceTypes`. Remove transitional registration aliases and legacy title decoding. Store rule record IDs directly in each action's JSON, preserving independent named scopes without auxiliary record tables. Initialize the sales example and Hub permission titles directly in their final form, without development-version upgrade scripts.
- 64b3fdb: Return translation descriptors for authorization options and translate them on the client. Language changes update resource, action, group, scope and subject labels without reloading permission data or discarding edits. Rule plugins expose their resource titles in client locales.
- 64b3fdb: Document business authorization development, scope-rule configuration, inherited subjects and server enforcement in the published Skills, with application-level guidance to select the authorization workflow. Make installed Skills self-contained with client integration, code-versus-seed decisions, complete API contracts and the current sales collaboration and delivery examples.
- 64b3fdb: Remove obsolete database field editors, user-directory helpers, and unused authorization management components. Preserve underlying grant policies when saving permission sets, share scope labels across rule plugins, and centralize unsaved-change handling in the permission workspace.
- 64b3fdb: Support settings navigation order across plugin contributions. Place the authorization inspector after rule management and align authorization page headings with other settings pages.

  Each rule plugin owns its shadcn primitives instead of importing them from the authorization management API.

- 64b3fdb: Disable rule creation and show setup guidance when no eligible business resources are defined. Remove fallback raw resource IDs and free-form action inputs from management editors.
- 64b3fdb: Focus authorization Skills on designing and implementing application business permissions. Consolidate repeated API guidance, add a policy-bound transactional workflow example, require model development and accompanying business permission configuration according to each requested change, and correct seed imports and optional-rule examples.
- 64b3fdb: Remove unused seed-directory declarations so server inspection succeeds in clean checkouts and installed applications without local empty directories.
- 64b3fdb: Add composed business operations with named data scopes and categorized business and administration groups. Permission and rule editors expose only this catalog; page, collection and custom resource handlers remain internal authorization targets.

  Enforce per-operation default access, sharing and restriction scopes while preserving field permissions. Return resolved underlying decisions and repository policies for inspection and execution.

  Use translation descriptors for permission titles, integrate permission-set assignments into user management, and demonstrate independent project, quote and order scopes with direct and team-based assignments.

- 64b3fdb: Remove Refine from client authorization checks. Use `AuthorizationClient.can({ resource, action })` instead of the removed two-argument signature, and import `useCan` from `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization/client`. Migrate page guards, navigation, and notification visibility while preserving session isolation and realtime permission invalidation.

  Remove the Refine access-control configuration and legacy global authorization client accessors. Resolve the application-owned client through `useAuthorizationClient()` or `authorizationClientToken`. Settings actions now revoke stale access immediately; route checks no longer bypass the authorization page or translate Refine CRUD action names.

  Unify route authorization under `authz: 'skip' | { resource: { type, id }, action }`. Normalize default rules during registration and share them across page guards, navigation, permission discovery, and inspection. Remove the legacy `access` field and string resource adapter.

  Limit settings action checks to the actions each page uses, keep the permission-set action helper internal, and avoid rebuilding navigation twice when selecting a route.

- 64b3fdb: Improve restriction rule table column sizing, align rule names to the left, display action scopes on separate lines, and remove the duplicate explanatory notice.
