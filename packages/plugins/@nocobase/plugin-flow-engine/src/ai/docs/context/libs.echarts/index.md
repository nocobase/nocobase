# ctx.libs.echarts

(Reserved) When you need to use ECharts in RunJS, you can access it via `ctx.importAsync` or a built-in wrapper. This context is only a placeholder and is not guaranteed to be available in all versions by default.

> If you need ECharts in a JSBlock, recommended options:
> - Use a visualization chart block
> - Or load on demand via `ctx.importAsync('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/echarts/+esm')`
