# ctx.getModel()

Get any model instance in FlowEngine (BlockModel / ActionModel / PageModel, etc.), usually by the model's `uid`.

Equivalent to calling `ctx.engine.getModel(uid)` on the current engine, which makes it easy to access other model instances in JS code.

## Type Definition (Simplified)

```ts
getModel(uid: string, searchInPreviousEngines?: boolean): FlowModel | undefined;
```

- `uid`: unique identifier of the target model instance (usually generated by the system and available in config or context)
- `searchInPreviousEngines`: optional, default `false`. In view/block-scope engines, set to `true` to search in upstream engines (reuse an already loaded model tree)

> Tip:
> - `ctx.getModel` is useful in JS Action / JS Field to get other model instances for advanced control
> - If you only need the current model or current block, prefer `ctx.model` or `ctx.blockModel` instead of `ctx.getModel`
