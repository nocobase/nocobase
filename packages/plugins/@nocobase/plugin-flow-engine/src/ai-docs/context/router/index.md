# ctx.router

`ctx.router` exposes the React Router instance so you can imperatively navigate, push history entries, or inspect the navigation stack within a flow.

## Example

- `@nocobase/plugin-flow-engine/context/router/basic.md` pushes new routes, replaces entries, and reads the current location from `ctx.router`.
