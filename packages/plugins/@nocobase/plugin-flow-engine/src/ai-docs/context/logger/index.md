# ctx.logger

`ctx.logger` is a Winston-based logger namespace scoped to the current flow. Use it to emit structured logs for debugging long-running steps.

## Example

- `@nocobase/plugin-flow-engine/context/logger/basic.md` illustrates logging at different levels (`info`, `error`) during a model’s execution.
