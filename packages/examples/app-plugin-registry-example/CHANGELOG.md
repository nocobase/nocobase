## 0.0.2-beta.5

### Patch Changes

- e123790: Move `@nocobase/app-server`, `@nocobase/app-client`, `@nocobase/app-plugin-authentication`, `@nocobase/app-plugin-users`, `@nocobase/app-plugin-hub`, `@nocobase/app-plugin-workflow` and `@nocobase/app-plugin-ai-employee` to the 2.0.0 prerelease line. The HTTP API migration released in 1.0.0-beta.N changed every route and the error body, but in prerelease mode a `major` changeset on a version that is already a `1.0.0` prerelease only increments the prerelease number, so nothing in the version said the change was breaking. These packages now release as `2.0.0-beta.0`, and every package that depends on or peers with one of them is released again so that its published range is `^2.0.0-beta.0` rather than a `^1.0.0-beta` range the new versions do not satisfy. An application upgrading to these versions upgrades all of them together.

### Patch Changes

- c8ddd7d: Consolidate the authorization API. Resource types are either catalog types (`settings`, `composite`, `database.collection`), whose items and actions must be registered, or record types (`page`, `user`, `notification`, `hub.app`, `hub.host`), which declare type-level actions and judge each record; there are no `*` items. Business resources become composite resources, a built-in core mechanism: every Authorization has `authz.compositeResources` (which replaces `authz.business`) and reserves the `composite` resource type, so `businessPlugin()` is gone with no replacement and `resourceTypes.add({ type: 'composite' })` throws; `defineBusinessResource` is `defineCompositeResource`, every `Business*` type is `CompositeResource*` (`CompositeResource`, `CompositeResourceBuilder`, `CompositeResourceActionBuilder`, `CompositeResourceReference`, `CompositeResourceConditions`, `CompositeResourceApi`, `BindableCompositeResourcePermission` and so on) and the grant policy is `{ type: 'composite', scopes }`. Resource types carry no `title`: they are never displayed, and the library holds no translation keys. A composite composes exactly the grants its definition lists, on any type except another composite. A data scope no longer names a `collection`: it targets the one resource its grant actions address (`dataScopeTarget(action, key)`), whose type must declare `recordAccess: true` on `resourceTypes.add`, as `database.collection` does; `define` checks this when the type is registered, and `authz.compositeResources.validate()` and first use check types registered later. The library holds no display concepts. `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization` provides `authz.ui`, also exposed to plugin setup contexts: `ui.sections.add` for the top-level sections `pages`, `business` and `administration` and one level of subsections (with `extend: true` for a subsection another plugin owns, as workflow owns `automation` and scheduler extends it), `ui.groups.add` for right-side groups, `ui.place(ref, { section, group? })`, and `ui.defaultSection(type, section)`. `pagesPlugin` registers the `pages.page` subsection, the only one the client fills, from its route tree. The client no longer remaps the `@nocobase/authorization` namespace. `authz.settings.add` no longer takes `section`; settings items and composites are placed with `authz.ui.place`, and unplaced ones land in their type's default section "Other". Startup validation runs after every provider has booted and reports unknown subsections and groups, placements of unregistered resources and unfit data scopes, throwing in development and logging a warning in production. A resource holds at most one default-access rule: the table is unique on `(resourceType, resourceId)` as well as `key`, and a second rule raises `DefaultAccessConflictError`, answered with 409. `authorizationToken` is the only service token: `permissionSetsToken` is gone, `authz.db` is now `authz.database`, settings items are registered with `authz.settings.add` and checked with semantic actions, and rule plugins build on `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization/server/extension`. The client exposes `AuthorizationClient.snapshot/revision/invalidate/onInvalidated` and renamed management components. Every client page route must now declare `authz` (a check or `'skip'`); nothing is inferred from the route name. The authorization migrations and seeds were edited in place, including the new `key` column on default-access rules, so existing databases must be reset and reinstalled. A stored composite grant that no longer expands — an unknown action or data scope, an invalid scope value or policy — is skipped for that grant alone instead of failing every check of the identity: it permits nothing, a direct check of its action denies with `INVALID_GRANT`, and `createAuthorization({ onInvalidGrant })` is told once, which the application plugin logs; `authz.compositeResources.validateGrant` explains a stored grant, and the plugin's startup validation scans every stored Permission Set, throwing in development and warning in production. `authz.database.collections.add` treats a re-registration with the same actions as a no-op even when its title or description differ, keeping the first and reporting a startup warning through `collections.warnings()`; only different actions throw. `authz.resourceTypes.get(type).items.add(item)` remains the generic low-level item registration that `settings.add`, `database.collections.add` and `compositeResources.define` build on.

### Patch Changes

- 52d1107: Resolve the shared UI packages through the workspace catalog: `@base-ui/react`, `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `lucide-react`, `shadcn`, `tailwind-merge`, and `tw-animate-css`.

  Every package already agreed on one version for each of these — the catalog is what keeps them agreeing. A range edited in one manifest and not the others would otherwise put two copies of a UI primitive into an application's bundle, which is the kind of drift nothing reports until a component behaves differently depending on which plugin rendered it.

  Peer dependencies use `catalog:` too. `pnpm pack` resolves it before publishing, so a consumer still reads an ordinary range.

- 52d1107: Declare the packages each plugin's browser code imports as peer dependencies, so an application that installs the plugin can resolve them while a server deployment installs none of them.

  A plugin's `client/` is not bundled by the plugin: `build` is `tsc`, so `dist/client/*.js` keeps its bare imports and the consuming application's Vite build resolves them. That application has only what the published manifest declares, and npm does not publish `devDependencies` — so a client import declared only there fails with `Could not resolve "…"`. `sonner` and `@xyflow/react` both shipped that way. Ten of these plugins appeared to work only because `app-template-default` happened to declare the same package for its own use; `@nocobase/app-plugin-hub`'s CodeMirror imports had no such coincidence and were unresolvable wherever it was installed.

  Peer dependencies are what satisfy both sides. An application installs one shared copy, and a deployment — which sets `autoInstallPeers: false` — installs none, so packages a server never requires stay out of it. Each keeps a matching devDependency so the workspace still resolves it and the version used here stays pinned. None is marked `optional`: an optional peer is not auto-installed anywhere, including in the application that needs it.

  `create-plugin` emits the same shape and its generated `AGENTS.md` teaches it, so a plugin created tomorrow declares its browser packages as peers rather than repeating the mistake.

- 52d1107: Declare each peer dependency once, dropping the devDependency that used to accompany it.

  The pairing was required on the grounds that a peer range is wide enough for development to drift off this repository's copy. It is not: pnpm installs a peer and links it into the plugin's own `node_modules`, resolving `workspace:^` to the same package `workspace:*` would. A plugin with the devDependency removed still links, typechecks, builds, and tests against it — verified against a clean install with every plugin's `node_modules` deleted first.

  What remained was a second declaration that changed nothing and had to be kept in step with the first. `pnpm peers:check` no longer asks for it, and `create-plugin` no longer emits it.

### Patch Changes

- 813da59: Declare browser-only packages as devDependencies rather than dependencies, and make `react-i18next` an optional peer of `@nocobase/i18n` provided by `@nocobase/app-client`. Client code is bundled by the consuming application, so these entries did nothing for the bundle while `dist/package.json` pulled every one of them into the server deployment to be installed and never required.

### Patch Changes

- 7cdffbd: Replace separate API and root route arrays with one ordered `routes` contribution array. Route factories now receive the Application, create and return their own Hono router, and are mounted automatically at `/api` or the application root according to their definition.

  Standardize plugin server modules around `providers/index.ts` and `routes/index.ts` collection entries, `services/` domain implementations, and a stable `tokens.ts` public contract.

  Generated plugins now declare conventional database and queue contribution directories by default. Missing optional directories are ignored until executable migrations, seeds, or jobs are added.

  Generated plugins now include an App-facing starter Agent Skill under the package's `skills/` directory. Plugin registration and skill synchronization copy these package-owned Skills into registered applications' `.agents/skills/` directories.

  Unify Client page contributions behind one `routes` loader. Plugins now use `defineAppRoutes()` and `defineSettingsRoutes()` to add child Routes to the application's two built-in Client Routes, mirroring how Server plugins use `defineRootRoutes()` and `defineApiRoutes()` with the built-in Hono routers.

## 0.0.2-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- c8f38c8: Register client plugins explicitly in the application's `client/plugins.ts` instead of discovering them from `nocobase.plugins` through a Vite virtual module.

  Each plugin now ships a `client/plugin.ts` descriptor, exported as `./client/plugin`, that declares its bootstrap, routes, providers, and route component overrides. An application composes them with `defineClientPlugins([...])`, where array order is bootstrap order and a plugin is enabled by being present. The entry is real, type-checked application source: it can be read, diffed, and edited, and Vite reloads it like any other module.

  Plugins can also accept options. `defineClientPlugin` takes an options type that reaches the bootstrap context, the routes and providers factories, and the route component overrides, so an application can pass a custom login page or a notification label at registration.

  `@nocobase/app-plugin-registry-example` only drops its now-unread `nocobase.plugin.client` manifest field; it contributes no client extensions.
