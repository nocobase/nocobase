# @nocobase/app-plugin-notification-example

## 1.0.0-beta.5

### Patch Changes

- be0fbbd: Client code merges class names with the `cn` package instead of `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`, so the plugins declare `cn` as a peer dependency in their place. The application templates provide it; an application that does not declare `cn` yet adds it to its `devDependencies`, or the client build cannot resolve these plugins. The AI employee registry item `nocobase-ai` lists `cn` instead of `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`, and the authentication plugin drops the two unused development dependencies.
- b0a5954: A task route given an id that is not a UUID, such as `/tasks/missing`, answers 403 `TASK_ACCESS_DENIED` like a task the caller cannot see, instead of 500 on PostgreSQL, Kingbase and MSSQL, which reject comparing a malformed value with the `uuid` column where SQLite and MySQL match nothing. An id given in uppercase now names the same task on every dialect, where before it matched only on dialects that compare `uuid` values natively.
- 6162033: Declare `@testing-library/user-event` as a development dependency, which the package's tests now use to open menus and selects. Nothing an application installs changes.

## 1.0.0-beta.4

### Patch Changes

- e123790: Move `@nocobase/app-server`, `@nocobase/app-client`, `@nocobase/app-plugin-authentication`, `@nocobase/app-plugin-users`, `@nocobase/app-plugin-hub`, `@nocobase/app-plugin-workflow` and `@nocobase/app-plugin-ai-employee` to the 2.0.0 prerelease line. The HTTP API migration released in 1.0.0-beta.N changed every route and the error body, but in prerelease mode a `major` changeset on a version that is already a `1.0.0` prerelease only increments the prerelease number, so nothing in the version said the change was breaking. These packages now release as `2.0.0-beta.0`, and every package that depends on or peers with one of them is released again so that its published range is `^2.0.0-beta.0` rather than a `^1.0.0-beta` range the new versions do not satisfy. An application upgrading to these versions upgrades all of them together.

## 1.0.0-beta.3

### Major Changes

- 21d274c: Move the example plugins' routes onto the HTTP API specification. Every example route now lives under a camelCase namespace, answers `{ data }` (lists `{ data, meta }`), validates its input with `zod` (an invalid request is `400 INVALID_INPUT` with `fieldViolations`, and an unknown body field is rejected), and reports failures in the standard error body with the example's namespace as `domain`. Clients branch on `error.reason`.

  - `@nocobase/app-plugin-repository-example`: authentication now guards the data endpoints at their new `POST /api/{name}/{action}` paths. Since data endpoints moved from `{name}:{action}` to `{name}/{action}`, the middleware registered on the colon paths matched nothing and the endpoints answered anonymous requests.
  - `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization-example`: `/api/authorization-example/...` becomes `/api/authorizationExample/...`. The `salesProjects` data endpoints are `POST /api/authorizationExample/salesProjects/{findMany,findOne,count,updateOne}`, and the `updateOne` input check runs again on that path. `POST /sales/quotes/:id` becomes `PATCH /sales/quotes/:quoteId` and `POST /sales/orders/:id/relations` becomes `PATCH /sales/orders/:orderId/relations`; both, and `submit` and `deliver`, answer `{ data }` with the record instead of `{ data: { saved: true } }`. `FORBIDDEN` is `403 PERMISSION_DENIED`, `STATE_CONFLICT` is `400 FAILED_PRECONDITION` instead of `409`, and `DELIVERY_REFERENCE_REQUIRED` and `INVALID_INPUT` are `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT`. A record outside the caller's scope is still answered `403`, never `404`. Every business route now decides the caller's composite action in middleware before it validates the request or looks up the record, so a caller without the action is answered `403` even for malformed input. `GET /sales/projects`, `/sales/quotes` and `/sales/orders` answer `{ data: [...], meta: { page, pageSize, total, navigation } }` instead of `{ data: { items, navigation } }` and take `page` and `pageSize` (default 20, at most 100). A relations update accepts only `carrier`, `checks` and `collaborators` (at least one), so any other key, a foreign key such as `carrierId` included, is `400 INVALID_INPUT` instead of `403`. Submitting a quote whose stored amount is not positive is `400 FAILED_PRECONDITION` with reason `QUOTE_AMOUNT_REQUIRED` and no field violation, instead of `400 INVALID_INPUT` naming `amount`; a reset before the example accounts are seeded is `400 FAILED_PRECONDITION` with reason `EXAMPLE_ACCOUNTS_MISSING` instead of `500`.
  - `@nocobase/app-plugin-departments-example`: `/api/departments-example/...` becomes `/api/departmentsExample/...`. `PUT /departments/:id/active` becomes `POST /departments/:departmentId/activate` and `/deactivate`; `PUT /departments/:id/members/:userId/primary` becomes `POST /departments/:departmentId/members/:userId/makePrimary`; both answer `{ data }` with the record. `DELETE /departments/:departmentId/members/:userId` answers `204`. `GET /users?search` becomes `GET /memberCandidates?q&page&pageSize` (default 20, at most 100) answering `{ data, meta: { page, pageSize, total } }`. A missing department or member is `404`, `DEPARTMENT_EXISTS` is `409 ALREADY_EXISTS`, and an unknown parent, manager or user named in the body is `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT` with a field violation. The settings check now runs before the path, query and body are validated, so a caller without the Departments settings item is answered `403` whatever it sent.
  - `@nocobase/app-plugin-jobs-example`: `GET /api/jobs-example/schedule` becomes `GET /api/jobsExample/rules` answering `{ data: rules, meta: { total } }`; `POST /api/jobs-example/schedule/:name/start|stop` becomes `POST /api/jobsExample/rules/:ruleName/start|stop`, whose body stays optional; `GET` and `POST /api/jobs-example/job` become `GET` and `POST /api/jobsExample/tasks`, answering `{ data: tasks, meta: { total } }` and `202 { data: task }`. `UNKNOWN_RULE` is `404`, `BUILT_IN_RULE` is `400 FAILED_PRECONDITION`, and `INVALID_INTERVAL` is `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Starting or stopping a rule changes it for the whole application, so it now requires the `update` action of the new settings item `jobsExample.schedules`, checked before the request is validated; a caller without it is answered `403 AUTHORIZATION_DENIED`. The example therefore requires `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization`.
  - `@nocobase/app-plugin-queue-example`: `GET /api/queue-example?delay=` published a job from a `GET`; it becomes `POST /api/queueExample/greet` with an optional `{ "delay": <ms> }` body. `POST /api/queue-example/digests` becomes `POST /api/queueExample/digests` answering `202 { data: receipts }`, and `GET /api/queue-example/deliveries` becomes `GET /api/queueExample/status` answering `{ data: { queue, configKey, deliveries } }`.
  - `@nocobase/app-plugin-notification-example`: `/api/notification-example/...` becomes `/api/notificationExample/...`, and `GET /users` becomes `GET /assignees`, answering `{ data, meta: { total } }`. A task's `createdAt` and `updatedAt` are answered as RFC 3339 UTC timestamps with the trailing `Z`. `GET /tasks` takes `page` and `pageSize` (default 20, at most 100) and answers `{ data, meta: { page, pageSize, total } }` instead of `{ data, total, page, pageSize }`. A caller who does not take part in a task is answered `403 TASK_ACCESS_DENIED`, whether or not the task exists, instead of `404 TASK_NOT_FOUND`.
  - `@nocobase/app-plugin-template-print-example`: `/api/template-print-example/...` becomes `/api/templatePrintExample/...`. `GET /invoices` is paged with `{ data, meta: { page, pageSize, total } }`, and `GET /invoices/:invoiceId/print?format=docx|pdf` still answers the file. A missing invoice is `404 INVOICE_NOT_FOUND` instead of `NOT_FOUND`, data over the example's output limits is `400 FAILED_PRECONDITION` with reason `OUTPUT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` instead of `413`, access to Sales Quotes is decided before the path and query are validated, and an unavailable PDF converter stays `503 PDF_CONVERTER_UNAVAILABLE`.
  - `@nocobase/app-plugin-file-example`: every exposure action, `uploadOne` and `uploadMany` included, now requires a signed-in user and answers an anonymous request `401 AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED` before the body is read; they were open to anonymous requests. The example therefore requires `@nocobase/app-plugin-authentication`. The content routes under each `accessPath` stay public.
  - `@nocobase/app-plugin-routes-example`: `GET /api/routes-example` becomes `GET /api/routesExample` answering `{ data }`. The root route `/routes-example/root` is unchanged.
  - `@nocobase/app-plugin-service-provider-example`: `GET /api/service-provider-example/status` becomes `GET /api/serviceProviderExample/status` answering `{ data }`.
  - `@nocobase/app-plugin-skills-example`: `GET /api/skills-example/notice` becomes `GET /api/skillsExample/notice` answering `{ data }`, and its Skill says so.
  - `@nocobase/app-template-examples`: the application's own routes follow the specification too. `GET /api/example` answers `{ data }`. `GET /api/articles` takes `q` instead of `search`, `page` and `pageSize` (default 20, at most 100) and answers `{ data, meta: { page, pageSize, total } }`; `POST /api/articles` answers `201 { data }` with the article; `PUT /api/articles/:id` becomes `PATCH /api/articles/:articleId` answering `{ data }`; article ids are strings; a missing article is `404 ARTICLE_NOT_FOUND`. `GET /api/numeric-examples` becomes `GET /api/numericExamples`, and its `sortField` and `sortDirection` parameters become one AIP-132 `orderBy`, a comma-separated list of field names each optionally followed by ` desc`, such as `orderBy=decimalValue desc,id`. The application's own routes report errors in the domain `examples` instead of `articles` and `numericExamples`, while the analytics and external CRM data endpoints answer `DATABASE_UNAVAILABLE` in the framework's domain `app` instead of `analytics` and `externalCrm`. The analytics and external CRM data endpoints are `POST /api/{name}/{action}`, and authentication guards them at those paths again: the middleware registered on the colon paths matched nothing, so they answered anonymous requests. Without a database, every database-backed route answers `503 UNAVAILABLE` with reason `DATABASE_UNAVAILABLE`.
  - `@nocobase/app-template-default`: its tests check for the renamed Routes example URL.

### Patch Changes

- 0b933b3: Every hand-written `/api` route of the example plugins and of the examples application now declares itself for the application's OpenAPI document with `describeRoute()`, `apiValidator()` and the response helpers from `@nocobase/app-server/router`, and is listed in Swagger UI at `/api/swagger/docs`. Each example uses its namespace in PascalCase as its tag (such as `QueueExample`) and an `operationId` of its namespace, a verb and the resource (such as `queueExamplePublishGreeting`), with shared response schemas in `server/routes/schemas.ts`. Input validation answers exactly as before. The public `GET /api/serviceProviderExample/status` and `GET /api/example` declare `security: []`, and the examples application hides the stand-in routes that answer `503 DATABASE_UNAVAILABLE` while it runs without a database. The routes, service provider and Skills examples now depend on `zod` for their response schemas. The READMEs describe the pattern, and the repository and file examples note that their data endpoints are documented without a declaration. Each route lists only the error statuses it can produce: the `400` for invalid input comes from the input validators, so a route lists `400` only for another reason such as a failed precondition, and one that checks no permission does not list `403`, so the article, numeric, routes, skills, queue, jobs, notification, practice-context and department-list routes name their statuses one by one instead of spreading `apiErrorResponses`. The examples application's `AGENTS.md` and `README.MD` explain where the Swagger UI and the JSON document are served, that reading them needs a signed-in session or an API key, and that an agent learns the endpoints from the document.
- be0fbbd: Tests in these plugins and example plugins take their fixtures from `@nocobase/app-testing` alone: database fixtures such as `createDatabaseTest()`, `describeMigration()` and `expectCollection()` from `@nocobase/app-testing/server`, and the command runner from `@nocobase/app-testing/cli`. Each package replaces its `@nocobase/db-testing` development dependency with `@nocobase/app-testing`. Nothing any of them ships changes.
- be0fbbd: Database tests in these plugins and example plugins take their database from `@nocobase/db-testing` instead of configuring an in-memory SQLite database, so they run on SQLite by default and on the database `NOCOBASE_TEST_DB_DIALECT` selects otherwise. Schema assertions that read `PRAGMA` output or `sqlite_master` are written with `expectCollection()` against Field and Collection names, migration up and down tests use `describeMigration()`, and the SQLite triggers that made a write fail are replaced by spies on the write. Each package replaces its `@nocobase/db-sqlite` development dependency with `@nocobase/db-testing`; nothing any of them ships changes.
