### Patch Changes

- e77641b: Point plugin guidance at `@nocobase/jobs` for background work, and at the rebuilt `@nocobase/queue` only for what jobs cannot do

  The Scheduler Skill now hands a target's lengthy work to a `JobExecutor` owned by the target's Provider, with the occurrence's own execution record as the reference, so a repeated start of the same occurrence returns the same reference; the job decides and reports its terminal outcome itself, because it cannot tell which executor attempt is the last. Recurring work without administrator visibility goes to a `ScheduleExecutor`, and only a one-time delay goes to a queue. Its description of Scheduler's own backend now names the jobs service and `scheduler.jobs` instead of the removed `queue.queues.schedule` connection. The Notification Skill's diagnostics check the jobs configuration Deliveries run on instead of a queue manager.

  The plugins' `AGENTS.md` list `@nocobase/queue` as a host-owned contract rather than a job registry. The jobs README states that background work goes there by default, the i18n Skill speaks of background jobs rather than queue jobs, and the departments example no longer composes the removed `QueueProvider` in its tests.

## 0.1.0-beta.14

### Patch Changes

- 02d5402: `@nocobase/app-cli` is now the whole application command line: it provides the `nocobase` bin and absorbs `@nocobase/nb3-cli` (command assembly, the plugin contract, plugin and Skill management) and `@nocobase/app-tools` (`dev`, `build`, `start`, `server-deps`). Neither of those two packages is published any more, and there is no compatibility period.

  - **Commands.** Standard commands leave the `app` topic: `nocobase db apply`, `nocobase config init`, `nocobase collections generate`. `app db doctor` is now `collections doctor`, `app i18n:check` is now `locales check`, and `app upload`/`app deploy` are `release upload`/`release deploy`, registered only when `package.json` sets `nocobase.cli.publishing: true`. New commands `dev`, `build`, `start`, `dist retarget` and `dist check` replace the application's `scripts/*.mjs`. `plugin skills sync` and `plugin cli-hooks` are removed; use `skills sync`. `app` now holds only an application's own commands.
  - **Discovery.** Commands are found by path: an application's `cli/commands/orders/sync.ts` answers to `nocobase app orders sync`, with no index to maintain. The bin finds the application from the nearest `package.json` (`nocobase.templateKind` for a source checkout, `nocobase.buildTarget` for a built `dist/`), or from `NOCOBASE_APP_ROOT`; applications no longer have a `cli/index.ts`. A built-in command runs without importing the application's plugins.
  - **Plugins.** A plugin's topic is its package name without the scope and `app-plugin-` prefix, so the scheduler's commands move from `schedule` to `scheduler` and the CLI example's from `demo` to `cli-example`. `defineCliPlugin` accepts `devCommands`, which a built `dist/` leaves out; the workflow plugin's `check` and `build` are development commands. Plugins declare `@nocobase/app-cli` as their peer instead of `@nocobase/nb3-cli`.
  - **Deployment.** `nocobase build` writes `dist/cli/index.js`, so `node dist/cli/index.js db apply` runs from any directory without pnpm; `dist/package.json` keeps only the `start` and `nocobase` scripts. The `migrate` and `seed` scripts it used to generate pointed at commands that no longer existed and are gone. Development tooling (`typescript`, `tsx`, `vite`, `prettier`, `tar`, `@nocobase/dev-config`) is an optional peer, so a deployment installs none of it.
  - **Templates.** Scripts are reduced to `postinstall`, `dev`, `build`, `start` and the quality checks; every other command is `pnpm nocobase <topic> <command>`. `scripts/`, `cli/index.ts` and `cli/commands/index.ts` are removed.

  Upgrading an existing application requires moving to the new layout in one step: see "Shared application scripts and commands" in the `nocobase-app-upgrade` Skill (`packages/app/app-skills/skills/nocobase-app-upgrade/references/edge-cases.md`) for the full procedure. Messages that named `nocobase app db repair` and similar commands now name the new ids.

- dbf5631: Replace guidance that named removed commands and layouts. The Hub's development page names the archive `nocobase build --tar` actually writes, `storage/exports/dist.tar.gz`. The scheduler Skill synchronizes with `pnpm nocobase scheduler sync` instead of `nb3 schedule:sync` and gives the deployed form, `node dist/cli/index.js scheduler sync --finalize`. The repository example applies its migrations and seeds with `nocobase db apply`, the CLI example's Skill matches its manifest and the stdout-only `--json` contract, and the i18n Skill no longer presents `pnpm i18n:check` as the monorepo form of `locales check`. Plugin `AGENTS.md` files carry the current dependency rules from the plugin template.

## 0.1.0-beta.13

### Patch Changes

- c8ddd7d: Consolidate the authorization API. Resource types are either catalog types (`settings`, `composite`, `database.collection`), whose items and actions must be registered, or record types (`page`, `user`, `notification`, `hub.app`, `hub.host`), which declare type-level actions and judge each record; there are no `*` items. Business resources become composite resources, a built-in core mechanism: every Authorization has `authz.compositeResources` (which replaces `authz.business`) and reserves the `composite` resource type, so `businessPlugin()` is gone with no replacement and `resourceTypes.add({ type: 'composite' })` throws; `defineBusinessResource` is `defineCompositeResource`, every `Business*` type is `CompositeResource*` (`CompositeResource`, `CompositeResourceBuilder`, `CompositeResourceActionBuilder`, `CompositeResourceReference`, `CompositeResourceConditions`, `CompositeResourceApi`, `BindableCompositeResourcePermission` and so on) and the grant policy is `{ type: 'composite', scopes }`. Resource types carry no `title`: they are never displayed, and the library holds no translation keys. A composite composes exactly the grants its definition lists, on any type except another composite. A data scope no longer names a `collection`: it targets the one resource its grant actions address (`dataScopeTarget(action, key)`), whose type must declare `recordAccess: true` on `resourceTypes.add`, as `database.collection` does; `define` checks this when the type is registered, and `authz.compositeResources.validate()` and first use check types registered later. The library holds no display concepts. `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization` provides `authz.ui`, also exposed to plugin setup contexts: `ui.sections.add` for the top-level sections `pages`, `business` and `administration` and one level of subsections (with `extend: true` for a subsection another plugin owns, as workflow owns `automation` and scheduler extends it), `ui.groups.add` for right-side groups, `ui.place(ref, { section, group? })`, and `ui.defaultSection(type, section)`. `pagesPlugin` registers the `pages.page` subsection, the only one the client fills, from its route tree. The client no longer remaps the `@nocobase/authorization` namespace. `authz.settings.add` no longer takes `section`; settings items and composites are placed with `authz.ui.place`, and unplaced ones land in their type's default section "Other". Startup validation runs after every provider has booted and reports unknown subsections and groups, placements of unregistered resources and unfit data scopes, throwing in development and logging a warning in production. A resource holds at most one default-access rule: the table is unique on `(resourceType, resourceId)` as well as `key`, and a second rule raises `DefaultAccessConflictError`, answered with 409. `authorizationToken` is the only service token: `permissionSetsToken` is gone, `authz.db` is now `authz.database`, settings items are registered with `authz.settings.add` and checked with semantic actions, and rule plugins build on `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization/server/extension`. The client exposes `AuthorizationClient.snapshot/revision/invalidate/onInvalidated` and renamed management components. Every client page route must now declare `authz` (a check or `'skip'`); nothing is inferred from the route name. The authorization migrations and seeds were edited in place, including the new `key` column on default-access rules, so existing databases must be reset and reinstalled. A stored composite grant that no longer expands — an unknown action or data scope, an invalid scope value or policy — is skipped for that grant alone instead of failing every check of the identity: it permits nothing, a direct check of its action denies with `INVALID_GRANT`, and `createAuthorization({ onInvalidGrant })` is told once, which the application plugin logs; `authz.compositeResources.validateGrant` explains a stored grant, and the plugin's startup validation scans every stored Permission Set, throwing in development and warning in production. `authz.database.collections.add` treats a re-registration with the same actions as a no-op even when its title or description differ, keeping the first and reporting a startup warning through `collections.warnings()`; only different actions throw. `authz.resourceTypes.get(type).items.add(item)` remains the generic low-level item registration that `settings.add`, `database.collections.add` and `compositeResources.define` build on.

## 0.1.0-beta.11

### Patch Changes

- fa01814: Add `db apply` and `db reset`, and retire `migrate --fresh`.

  `nocobase app db apply` (`pnpm db:apply`) runs migrations and seeds as one plan, in the order startup runs them: each connection is migrated, then seeded. Only pending tasks run, so repeating it is safe. `nocobase app db reset` (`pnpm db:reset`) drops every managed schema object first and reruns both from empty; it asks for confirmation and requires `--force` in CI or a non-interactive terminal.

  `migrate --fresh` is removed and now exits with a pointer to `db reset`. It rebuilt the schema without reseeding, so it left the seed history cleared and no seed executed — the default connection recovered on the next startup, and a connection with `autoRun: false` did not.

  The `migrate` and `seed` commands are removed along with their template scripts; `db apply` replaces both. Running one half on its own is not a separate command, because both halves apply only what is pending: on an already-migrated database `db apply` applies seeds alone, and the one case it does not cover — migrating ahead of a deployment without seeding — can be served by a flag later without breaking anything.

  `runAppDatabaseTasks` accepts several task kinds in one plan through its `kind` option, which is what makes a reset correct across both kinds: one plan means a connection's schema is rebuilt by its migrations task before its seeds run.

### Patch Changes

- 64b3fdb: Remove Refine from client authorization checks. Use `AuthorizationClient.can({ resource, action })` instead of the removed two-argument signature, and import `useCan` from `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization/client`. Migrate page guards, navigation, and notification visibility while preserving session isolation and realtime permission invalidation.

  Remove the Refine access-control configuration and legacy global authorization client accessors. Resolve the application-owned client through `useAuthorizationClient()` or `authorizationClientToken`. Settings actions now revoke stale access immediately; route checks no longer bypass the authorization page or translate Refine CRUD action names.

  Unify route authorization under `authz: 'skip' | { resource: { type, id }, action }`. Normalize default rules during registration and share them across page guards, navigation, permission discovery, and inspection. Remove the legacy `access` field and string resource adapter.

  Limit settings action checks to the actions each page uses, keep the permission-set action helper internal, and avoid rebuilding navigation twice when selecting a route.

- 64b3fdb: Reuse list-page permissions for repository detail routes and correct the authorization example's stored page grants to use route names.

### Patch Changes

- a2dbe54: Publish only the compiled `dist/database`, no longer the TypeScript sources beside it. The runtime resolves a plugin's declared `database/migrations` and `database/seeds` against the package directory first and its `dist` second, so an installed plugin that shipped both served the sources, and Node refuses to strip types from a file under `node_modules`: `@nocobase/app-plugin-ai-employee` failed every application start with `Stripping types is currently unsupported for files under node_modules` while every development checkout, which resolves the same sources outside `node_modules`, kept working.

## 0.1.0-beta.4

### Patch Changes

- ceb356b: Fix published package metadata and database test driver registration.
- c960d07: Replace the Repository API's per-action `writePolicy` with a Repository Policy
  declared once per exposure.

  **Breaking.** `defineRepositoryApiRoutes()` no longer accepts `writePolicy` on
  an action, and every exposure must declare a `policy`. An action configuration
  now says only that an endpoint exists; what it may do is the exposure's Policy,
  which governs reading, creating, updating and deleting together. Declaring one
  is required rather than optional because `writePolicy` defaulted to refusing
  writes while an absent Policy restricts nothing — making it optional would have
  turned every existing declaration from "refuse every write" into "allow
  everything" without a word of warning.

  Declare `policy` as a function of a principal, together with a
  `principal(context)` resolver, to scope rows to the caller. The resolver belongs
  to the application, since this router installs no authentication; one that
  returns nothing refuses the request with 403 `PRINCIPAL_REQUIRED` rather than
  binding a Policy built from a principal that is not there. A fixed Policy is
  still normalized when the routes are defined, so a malformed one fails where it
  is written; a Policy function cannot be, and its `INVALID_POLICY` now reaches
  the host error handler as a server error instead of being reported to the caller
  as a 400.

  `@nocobase/db` gains `buildRepositoryPolicy`, a builder whose unmentioned nodes
  are denied, so the four-node requirement costs nothing to satisfy while the
  default stays refusal. Two related fixes travel with it: `create`, `update` and
  `delete` nodes that are `false` now refuse a write before its payload is read,
  so an empty body is reported as forbidden rather than as invalid input; and a
  `create` node whose relations grant `update`, `upsert`, `disconnect`, `set` or
  `delete` is refused during normalization, since a root create performs none of
  them.

  `@nocobase/app-plugin-file` exposures declare a Policy too, and it reaches
  uploads: the upload path binds a Policy derived from the exposure's, inheriting
  `create.scope` and `create.defaults` and substituting the file columns for the
  field allowlist. A file uploaded under a scoped Policy therefore lands inside
  the scope the same exposure reads from. The public content route under
  `accessPath` is unchanged and deliberately outside it.

  The method-level `writePolicy` option on `db.repository()` calls is unaffected
  and remains available for narrowing a single call.

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- 52d1107: Resolve the shared UI packages through the workspace catalog: `@base-ui/react`, `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `lucide-react`, `shadcn`, `tailwind-merge`, and `tw-animate-css`.

  Every package already agreed on one version for each of these — the catalog is what keeps them agreeing. A range edited in one manifest and not the others would otherwise put two copies of a UI primitive into an application's bundle, which is the kind of drift nothing reports until a component behaves differently depending on which plugin rendered it.

  Peer dependencies use `catalog:` too. `pnpm pack` resolves it before publishing, so a consumer still reads an ordinary range.

- 52d1107: Declare the packages each plugin's browser code imports as peer dependencies, so an application that installs the plugin can resolve them while a server deployment installs none of them.

  A plugin's `client/` is not bundled by the plugin: `build` is `tsc`, so `dist/client/*.js` keeps its bare imports and the consuming application's Vite build resolves them. That application has only what the published manifest declares, and npm does not publish `devDependencies` — so a client import declared only there fails with `Could not resolve "…"`. `sonner` and `@xyflow/react` both shipped that way. Ten of these plugins appeared to work only because `app-template-default` happened to declare the same package for its own use; `@nocobase/app-plugin-hub`'s CodeMirror imports had no such coincidence and were unresolvable wherever it was installed.

  Peer dependencies are what satisfy both sides. An application installs one shared copy, and a deployment — which sets `autoInstallPeers: false` — installs none, so packages a server never requires stay out of it. Each keeps a matching devDependency so the workspace still resolves it and the version used here stays pinned. None is marked `optional`: an optional peer is not auto-installed anywhere, including in the application that needs it.

  `create-plugin` emits the same shape and its generated `AGENTS.md` teaches it, so a plugin created tomorrow declares its browser packages as peers rather than repeating the mistake.

- 52d1107: Declare each peer dependency once, dropping the devDependency that used to accompany it.

  The pairing was required on the grounds that a peer range is wide enough for development to drift off this repository's copy. It is not: pnpm installs a peer and links it into the plugin's own `node_modules`, resolving `workspace:^` to the same package `workspace:*` would. A plugin with the devDependency removed still links, typechecks, builds, and tests against it — verified against a clean install with every plugin's `node_modules` deleted first.

  What remained was a second declaration that changed nothing and had to be kept in step with the first. `pnpm peers:check` no longer asks for it, and `create-plugin` no longer emits it.

### Patch Changes

- 9536bf5: Reach the API client through `@nocobase/app-client` instead of importing `@nocobase/api-client` directly from the example plugin's client code. The plugin value-imported `ApiClientError` and `buildFindManyOptions` from a package it declares only as a `devDependency`, which resolved solely because pnpm happened to hoist that package for another consumer. `ApiClientError` is also compared with `instanceof`, so a second copy would make the check silently return false and leave `error.code` undefined under code that looks correct. Re-export `buildFindManyOptions` alongside the existing `ApiClientError` so the plugin resolves both through the single copy the application already provides.

### Minor Changes

- 90a4903: Add a Repository API example plugin with relational CRM and order tables, transactional sample data seeds, authenticated CRUD endpoints, and localized management pages with grouped navigation, detail child routes and create/edit drawers, product-aware order details and nested order-item creation. Include an atomic numeric update playground with seeded counters, guarded deductions and concurrent increments. Add aggregate statistics, status filters, product grouping with HAVING, and customer relation counts over the seeded orders. Enable the example in the Default Template.
- 90a4903: Add self-contained migrations and deterministic seed data for six prefixed relationship-write example collections.
- 90a4903: Add a seeded example page comparing array and streamed `findMany` consumption.
- 90a4903: Add an authenticated interactive page demonstrating nested and incremental Repository HTTP relationship writes, including through payloads and target lifetime checks.
- 566492d: Replace the combined relationship-write walkthrough with independent forms and tables for create, connect, disconnect, set, update, upsert, and delete. Support hasOne, hasMany, and many-to-many examples with isolated targets, through-role inputs, request previews, and explicit relationship and target-lifetime feedback. Expand the example repositories' nested-write allowlists to cover these operations.
- 566492d: Add five interactive select combine examples covering independent branches, relation aggregates, nested selections, shared and branch-local filters, and many-to-many relations, with tabular results, nested record tables, and inspectable JSON requests and responses.
- 566492d: Add interactive Repository sorting examples covering field order, stable ties, NULL placement, relation paths and aggregates, local include ordering, and invalid sort targets, with builder snippets, serialized requests, and tabular results.

### Patch Changes

- 90a4903: Support enum fields as Repository groupBy keys with exact member identity across database collations, nullable groups and stored-value validation. Preserve existing enum ordering restrictions. Replace per-status aggregate queries in the Repository example with a single enum groupBy request.
- 90a4903: Add server-owned writePolicy for single and bulk creates/updates, root upserts and
  mutation preflight. Internal Repository calls default to true. Explicit policies
  restrict scalar fields, each relation operation, nested create/update/upsert branches
  and through payloads before any writes. Add buildWritePolicy, buildUpsertWritePolicy
  and synchronous callback input, frozen snapshots and structured policy errors.

  Replace defineRepositoryApiRoutes action arrays with configuration objects and move
  maxLimit to actions.findMany. API create/update actions default to writePolicy false
  and require explicit allowlists; true and client-supplied policies are rejected.
  Return HTTP 403 for forbidden writes and migrate the Repository example's routes,
  fixtures and integration guidance to field and relationship policies.

- 90a4903: Align example filter and sort ASTs with the stricter Repository input types, including aggregate relation filters.
- 90a4903: Extend the aggregate page with customer order ranking, customer/status and product/price grouping examples. Add interactive row-count HAVING filters, readable relation links and per-panel request/result traces using the existing seed data.
- 90a4903: Expose opt-in aggregate and groupBy Repository HTTP actions with JSON AST validation, grouped filters and sorting, and lossless BigInt result serialization. Add matching remote Repository methods and public types. Switch the aggregate example to the generic authenticated endpoints and display its actual Repository requests.
