# @nocobase/snowflake

## 1.0.0-beta.4

### Patch Changes

- cf23bfe: Republish every package so the `latest` dist-tag points at its current beta release, matching `beta`.

## 1.0.0-beta.3

### Major Changes

- 174eab5: Rename four packages, dropping the qualifiers they only carried to avoid names the v2 line had taken.

  | Before                     | After                  |
  | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
  | `@nocobase/app-database`   | `@nocobase/db`         |
  | `@nocobase/app-i18n`       | `@nocobase/i18n`       |
  | `@nocobase/app-server-kit` | `@nocobase/app-server` |
  | `@nocobase/id-generator`   | `@nocobase/snowflake`  |

  There is no compatibility shim: the old names receive no further releases, and a dependency on one has to be repointed by hand. Each package keeps its version history, which is why the changelogs say which name the earlier releases went out under.

  `@nocobase/app-server` reclaims a name the v2 line abandoned at `0.11.1-alpha.5`, so it starts at `1.0.0-beta.0` rather than continuing its own `0.1.0-beta` line — `0.1.0` sorts below `0.11.1`, and npm would have rejected the publish. The other three take names that were never published.

  `@nocobase/snowflake` also now matches what it implements; its only source file was already called `snowflake.ts`.

The versions below were published as `@nocobase/id-generator`, the name this package carried until it was renamed to
`@nocobase/snowflake`. They are kept because they describe this same codebase; the `@nocobase/id-generator` releases they
name are not, and never will be, versions of `@nocobase/snowflake`.

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- ac3f033: Replace aggregated application configuration objects and config factories with typed module-owned configuration definitions. Applications now compose defaults, file providers, environment layers, validation, explicit reloads, and subscriptions through `AppConfig`, while providers read their configuration through `app.config.get(definition)`.

## 0.0.1-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- ce4eab8: Add a focused ServiceProvider plugin example with a tokenized heartbeat
  service, lifecycle management, and an HTTP status route. Pass the Application
  directly to providers and standardize service access through `app.container`.
- Updated dependencies [ce4eab8]
  - @nocobase/service-provider@0.0.2-beta.0

## 0.0.1-beta.0
